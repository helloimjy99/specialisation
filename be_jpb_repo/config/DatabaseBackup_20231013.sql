S. Vasan of Gemini Studios. Starring T. R. Rajakumari, M. K. Radha and Ranjan, the film follows two brothers who fight over ruling their father\'s kingdom and marrying the village dancer, Chandralekha. Veppathur Kittoo developed a story based on a chapter of Robert Macaire; or, The French Bandit in England, a novel by George W. M. Reynolds. The film spent five years in production, undergoing a number of scripting, filming and cast changes, and was the most expensive film made in India at the time. Vasan mortgaged all his property and sold his jewellery to complete the film. The Tamil version (poster pictured), released on 9 April 1948, did not recoup production costs. Vasan directed a Hindi version with some changes, which was a box-office success. South Indian cinema became prominent throughout India with the film\'s release, inspiring South Indian producers to market their Hindi films in North India.

V., commonly abbreviated to BFC Dynamo (German pronunciation: [beːʔɛfˌt͡seː dyˈnaːmo] (listen)) or BFC (German pronunciation: [beːʔɛfˈt͡seː] (listen)), alternatively sometimes called Dynamo Berlin, is a German football club based in the locality of Alt-Hohenschönhausen of the borough of Lichtenberg of Berlin. BFC Dynamo was founded in 1966 from the football department of SC Dynamo Berlin and became one of the most successful clubs in East German football. The club is the record champion of East Germany with ten consecutive league championships from 1979 through 1988. BFC Dynamo competes in the fourth tier Regionalliga Nordost. The club enjoys a cross-city rivalry with 1. FC Union Berlin and a historical rivalry with SG Dynamo Dresden. The rivalry with Union Berlin is part of the Berlin derby.\\n\\nHistory\\nBackgrund, founding and rise (1954–1978)\\nMain article: History of Berliner FC Dynamo (1954–1978)\\nBackground: SC Dynamo Berlin (1954–1966)\\nBFC Dynamo started as a football department of sports club SC Dynamo Berlin. SC Dynamo Berlin was founded on 1 October 1954 as one of the new elite sports clubs in East Germany.[2] The sports club was affiliated to sport association SV Dynamo. In order to establish a competitive side in Berlin, the team of SG Dynamo Dresden and its place in the DDR-Oberliga was transferred to the new sports club SC Dynamo Berlin. The relocation was designed to give the capital a team that would rival teams from West Berlin such as Hertha BSC, which were still popular in East Berlin.[3][4][5][nb 1][nb 2]\\n\\n\\nGünter Schröter (left), Horst Kohle of ASK Vorwärts Berlin (centre) and Martin Skaba (right) during a match between Vorwärts Berlin and Dynamo Berlin at the Walther-Ulbricht-Stadion on 18 October 1959\\nThe team played its first match as SC Dynamo Berlin against BSG Rotation Babelsberg in the 1954-55 DDR-Oberliga on 21 November 1954. Among the players delegated from SG Dynamo Dresden were Johannes Matzen, Herbert Schoen and Günter Schröter. SC Dynamo Berlin finished its first season in the DDR-Oberliga in seventh place. The team was relatively successful in the 1955 DDR-Oberliga, but suffered relegation to the second tier DDR-Liga after the 1956 DDR-Oberliga. SC Dynamo Berlin played a friendly match against Polish side Górniczy KS Szombierki Bytom in front of 80,000 spectators at the Walter-Ulricht-Stadion on 9 May 1957.[18][19] The attendance number is allegedly the highest in the history of the club.[19][nb 3] SC Dynamo Berlin eventually finished the 1957 DDR-Liga in first place immediately returned to the DDR-Oberliga.\\n\\nGünter Schröter and Herbert Maschke would remain central players to the team into early the 1960s. But most other players of the former SG Dynamo Dresden team were no longer active in the team by the late 1950s.[21] Herbert Schoen had played his last competitive matches for the team during the 1957 season and Johannes Matzen had suffered a serious injury during the 1958 season and consequently had to end his playing career.[22] The team was now instead shaped by a new generation of players, including Martin Skaba, Werner Heine, Waldemar Mühlbächer, Hermann Bley and Konrad Dorner (de).[23]\\n\\n\\nThe team of SC Dynamo Berlin after winning the 1959 FDGB-Pokal, at the Bruno-Plache-Stadion in Leipzig on 13 December 1959\\nSC Dynamo Berlin had difficulties establishing itself in football in East Berlin.[17] The team rarely drawing crowds larger than 5,000 spectators at the Walter-Ulbricht-Stadion. SC Dynamo Berlin finally won its first trophy in the 1959 FDGB-Pokal. However, the team would not be allowed to participate in the 1960-61 European Cup Winners\' Cup. The East German Football Association (DFV) found local rival and league runner-up ASK Vorwärts Berlin to be a more suitable representative of East Germany in the competition.[24]\\n\\nSC Dynamo Berlin also had some success in the first seasons of the 1960s. The team fished the 1960 DDR-Oberliga as runner-up. SC Dynamo Berlin was a top team also in the 1961-62 DDR-Oberliga. The team participated in the 1961–62 International Football Cup during the summer of 1961. SC Dynamo Berlin was successful in 1961-62 FDGB-Pokal. The team was only defeated 1-3 by SC Chemie Halle in the final.[25] However, SC Dynamo Berlin still found itself overshadowed in the capital by the army-sponsored ASK Vorwärts Berlin.[26] The team of SC Dynamo Berlin during the 1960s would eventually prove relatively weak.[27] SC Dynamo Berlin had become a lower table side by the end of the 1962–63 Oberliga.[21]\\n\\nEast German football was reformed in 1965–66, when the football departments of ten sports clubs (SC) were made independent from their sports clubs to form ten dedicated football clubs. The new designated football clubs (FC) would form the elite of East German football. As part of the reorganization, the football section of SC Dynamo Berlin was separated from the sports club and reorganized as football club BFC Dynamo.[28][29][4][30] The football department of sports community SG Dynamo Hohenschönhausen was also disbanded after the 1965–66 season. The players of SG Dynamo Hochenschönhausen joined the reserve team BFC Dynamo II and BFC Dynamo II took over the place of SG Dynamo Hohenschönhausen in the 1966-67 Bezirksliga Berlin.\\n\\nFounding and second relegation (1966–1967)\\nBFC Dynamo was founded on 15 January 1966.[31] The new club was presented by the President of SV Dynamo Erich Mielke at a ceremony in the Dynamo-Sporthalle in Hohenschönhausen in East Berlin.[32] The first presidium included the Head of the Volkspolizei in East Berlin Horst Ende, the Intendant of the Metropol theatre Hans Pitra, former DDR-Oberliga player Johannes Matzen and the Editor-in-chief of the East German football weekly Die Neue Fußballwoche (FuWo) (de) Klaus Schlegel.[33] Manfred Kirste was elected club president and Mielke was elected honorary president.[32][31] Kirste came from Berlin and was a certified sports teacher.[34]\\n\\n\\nThe match between BFC Dynamo and FC Vorwärts Berlin in the DDR-Oberliga at the Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum on 13 August 1966\\nThe new designated football clubs (FC) were formed as centers of excellence in East German football, with the right to draw on talents within designated geographical and administrative areas.[4][29] BFC Dynamo was initiallly assigned Bezirk Cottbus and one third of East Berlin as catchment area.[35] BFC Dynamo was officially a club of the Ministry of the Interior, and the club\'s official sponsor was the Volkspolizei.[36][37] However, the honorary chairman Mielke was the head of the Stasi and most of the club\'s sponsoring members would eventually be made up of Stasi employees. BFC Dynamo would come to receive personal, organizational and financial support from the Stasi.[37][38] Research by the Stasi Records Agency has shown that 31 employees of the Ministry of the Interior and ten employees of the Stasi would eventually be involved in the club.[39]\\n\\nSC Dynamo Berlin had been in first place in the 1965-66 DDR-Oberliga after the eighth matchday.[40] BFC Dynamo were still in a good fourth place after a 2–0 win over BSG Chemie Leipzig on the 23rd matchday on 16 April 1966. However, the team then lost its last three matches in the league, against F.C. Hansa Rostock, SG Dynamo Dresden and FC Rot-Weiß Erfurt, and finished the season in ninth place.[41]\\n\\nHungarian Bela Volentik was new coach for the 1966–67 season. The team played a friendly match against Polish side Pogoń Szczecin on 10 September 1966. The match would be one of many in a long series of friendly maches against Pogoń Szczecin during the East German era.[42][nb 4] The team struggled in the 1966-67 DDR-Oberliga. BFC Dynamo faced local rivals 1. FC Union Berlin away on the 22nd matchday on 26 April 1967. BFC Dynamo was in 13th place in the league and threatened with relegation.[44][45] Supporters of 1. FC Union Berlin mocked the team with a banner saying \\\"We greet the relegated\\\". 1. FC Union Berlin won the match 3-0 and BFC Dynamo was now practically relegated.[45] The match is seen as the starting point for the feud between the two clubs.[45] BFC Dynamo eventually finished the 1966-67 DDR-Oberliga in 13th place and was again relegated to the DDR-Liga. Long-time player Waldemar Mühlbächer retired from his playing career after the season.[46] Mühlbächer had joined SC Dynamo Berlin in 1956 and had played 11 seasons for the team.[47]\\n\\nRejuvenation and first UEFA competition (1967–1972)\\nFormer SC Dynamo Berlin forward Karl Schäffner returned as coach for the 1967–68 season.[48] BFC Dynamo dominated the 1967-68 DDR-Liga Nord. The team was undefeated during the second half of the league season and immediately won promotion back to the DDR-Oberliga.[49] Forward Peter Lyszczan became tied league top goalscorer in the 1967-68 DDR-Liga Nord with 19 goals.[50] Martin Skaba and Hermann Bley retired after the 1967–68 season and Konrad Dorner was transferred to the reserve team BFC Dynamo II.[51] The three had joined SC Dynamo Berlin between 1956 and 1958. Skaba had played in a total of 343 matches for the team.[52]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo began a rejuvenation of the team during the 1967–68 season.[51] Among the players from the youth department who got to play matches in the 1967-68 DDR-Liga Nord were Harald Schütze (de), Norbert Johannsen and Werner Voigt.[53] BFC Dynamo fielded a young team in the 1968–69 season. The average age of the team was 23 years at the start of the season.[54] Harald Schütze was now a regular player in the team.[51] BFC Dynamo got off to a difficult start on its return to the DDR-Oberliga. Hans Geitel took over as coach for the second half of the season. Geitel had previously worked in the youth academy of BFC Dynamo.[55] The team finished the 1968-69 DDR-Oberliga in tenth place.\\n\\nBFC Dynamo recruited young forward Ralf Schulenberg from FC Rot-Weiß Erfurt for the 1969–70 season.[56] Schulenberg was probably compensation for the talented Günter Wolff, who had left BFC Dynamo for FC Rot-Weiß Erfurt after the 1967–68 season.[55] A number of players from the youth departments would also make their debut in the DDR-Oberliga in the following seasons, such as Peter Rohde (de) in 1969, Frank Terletzki in 1969 and Bernd Brillat in 1970. BFC Dynamo reached the final of the 1970-71 FDGB-Pokal. The team lost the final 1–2 in overtime to SG Dynamo Dresden, but qualified for the next season\'s UEFA Cup Winners\' Cup as runner-up.[57] This time, the team would also be allowed to participate in the competition, unlike in 1960. BFC Dynamo was thus finally ready for its first participation in an UEFA competition.[58]\\n\\nA number of football clubs became specially promoted focus clubs (German: Schwerpunktclubs) in the 1970 DFV Football Resolution (German: DFV-Fußballbeschluss).[59][60] BFC Dynamo and FC Vorwärts Berlin became focus clubs in East Berlin.[60][61] The football landscape in East Berlin would then change dramatically ahead of the 1971–72 season, when the Ministry of Defense decided to relocate FC Vortwärts Berlin to Frankfurt an der Oder.[62][63] BFC Dynamo and 1. FC Union Berlin were from now on the only major football clubs in East Berlin.[64] BFC Dynamo would be allowed to take over the catchment area in East Berlin that had previously belonged to FC Vorwärts Berlin.[65][64] The team would also have the opportunity to play more matches at the larger and more centrally located Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark in Prenzlauer Berg, which led to increased interest in the club and growing attendance numbers.[66]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo stood out among other teams within SV Dynamo. BFC Dynamo was located at the frontline of the Cold War. It was also a representative of the East German capital. This meant that the club had to be well equipped.[67] BFC Dynamo would eventually get access to a nationwide scouting network, including numerous training centers (German: Trainingszentrum) (TZ) of SV Dynamo across East Germany.[68][nb 5] BFC Dynamo would eventually be able to recruit young talented players from 38 training centers (TZ) across East Germany. By comparison, 1. FC Union Berlin only had access to 6 training centers (TZ), all of which were located in the Berlin area.[70]\\n\\nThe team was joined by forward Wolf-Rüdiger Netz from SG Dynamo Schwerin for the 1971–72 season.

The team eliminated Cardiff City F.C. in the first round and then K Beerschot VA in the second round. BFC Dynamo would now also show its strength in the DDR-Oberliga. The team was unbeaten in the first six league matches after the winter break, including wins against top teams 1. FC Magdeburg and SG Dynamo Dresden.[72] The team eliminated Åtvidabergs FF in the quarter-finals of the 1971–72 UEFA Cup Winners\' Cup and advanced to the semi-finals.[73] BFC Dynamo thus became the first team from Berlin to reach the semi-finals in one of the two most prestigious UEFA competitions (the European Cup and the European Cup Winners\' Cup). BFC Dynamo was eventually eliminated by Dynamo Moscow in the semi-finals after a penalty shoot-out at the Druzhba Stadium in Lviv in the return leg on 20 April 1972.[74] The team finished the 1971-72 DDR-Oberliga as runner-up.\\n\\nRise in the DDR-Oberliga (1972–1978)\\nBFC Dynamo was qualified for the 1972-73 UEFA Cup. The team eliminated Angers SCO and Levski Sofia in the first two rounds. BFC Dynamo was then set to play Liverpool F.C. in the third round.

FC Union Berlin for of the 1973–74 season.[78] Numerous players were tried during the season. Not a single player played all 26 league matches during the 1973–74 season.[81] The team finished also the 1973-74 DDR-Oberliga in sixth place. Martin Skaba became the new assistant coach for the 1974–75 season.[82] BFC Dynamo recruited young defender Michael Noack (de) from relegated BSG Energie Cottbus for the season.[82] League results improved and BFC Dynamo finished the 1974-75 DDR-Oberliga in fourth place.

However, the loss in the return match in the 1976-77 DDR-Oberliga would be the last ever defeat against 1. FC Union Berlin in the DDR-Oberliga.[95] BFC Dynamo came back with a 6–0 win over F.C. Hansa Rostock on the following matchday on 26 February 1977. Wolf-Rüdiger Netz scored a legendary hat-trick in the match, with three goals in the 63rd, 64th and 66th match minutes.[98]\\n\\n30-year-old Jürgen Bogs became the new coach for the 1977–78 season.[99][100][101] Bogs had a background as a youth coach in the club.

The Stasi feated riots, political demonstrations and supporters who might express sympathy for West German stars such as Felix Magath. Only 2,000 tickets were allowed for ordinary fans. The rest was instead allocated to a politically hand-picked audience.[135][136][137] The first leg ended 1–1 in front of 22,000 spectators at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark.

The team had scored a total of 90 goals during the league season, which set a new record for the number of goals in one DDR-Oberliga season.[160] No team would ever score more goals in one season in the DDR-Oberliga. Rainer Ernst was once again the best goal scorer in the league with 24 goals. Frank Pastor was the second best goal scorer in the league with 22 goals.[161] BFC Dynamo reached the final of the FDGB-Pokal for a second consecutive season and once again faced rival SG Dynamo Dresden in the final.

Youg defender Jörg Fügner from the youth departent made his debut for BFC Dynamo in the DDR-Oberliga towards the end of the first half of the season.[163] BFC Dynamo was in first place in the league before the winter break.[164] The team faced fourth-placed 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig on the 18th matchday. 1. FC Lokomotiv Leipzig led the match 1–0 in overtime. BFC Dynamo was then awarded a penalty in the 94th minute.[165] Frank Pastor safely converted the penalty and the match ended in a 1–1 draw.[166] The penalty was highly controversial and would later become known as the \\\"Shame penalty of Leipzig\\\".[167] BFC Dynamo also faced 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig in the two-legged semi-finals of the 1985-86 FDGB-Pokal. BFC Dynamo was eliminated on the away goals rule. 1.

FC Lokomotive Leipzig. Long time-player Frank Terletzki retired from his playing career after the season. Terletzki had played in a total of 489 matches for BFC Dynamo since 1969.[172]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo had the best material conditions in the league and the best team by far.[173] But controversial refereeing decisions in favor of BFC Dynamo gave rise to speculation that the dominance of BFC Dynamo was not solely due to athletic performance, but also due to help from referees.[174] BFC Dynamo was a representative of both the Stasi and the capital. The team was therefore viewed with more suspicion than affection.[175][174] The overbearing success of BFC Dynamo in the 1980s made fans of opposing teams easily aroused as to what they saw as manipulation by bent referees.[173][176] The team was met with aggression and shouts such as \\\"Bent champions!\\\" (German: Schiebermeister) and \\\"Jews Berlin!\\\" at away matches.[177][4][178][179] Complaints of alleged referee bias accumulated.[173][4][180] The German Football Association of the GDR (DFV) eventually conducted a secret review of the 1984-85 DDR-Oberliga.[173][167][181] Among other things, the review found that BFC Dynamo had earned only one third of the yellow cards incurred by rival SG Dynamo Dresden.[182][183][181] A review was also made of the final of the 1984-85 FDGB-Pokal final between BFC Dynamo and SG Dynamo Dresden. This review found that 30 percent of the referee decisions were wrong, and that 80 percent of those had been of disadvantage to SG Dynamo Dresden.[184][185][186][181] A number of referees were sanctioned for their performances in matches involving BFC Dynamo in the following months, including the referees involved in the cup final.[4][186][181]\\n\\nA particularly controversial episode was the penalty awarded to BFC Dynamo by referee Bernd Stumpf in extra time in the match between 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig and BFC Dynamo on 22 March 1986. The penalty caused a wave of protests.[167][187][174] SED General Secretary Erich Honecker and Secretary for Security, Youth and Sport of the SED Central Committee Egon Krenz were fed up with the \\\"football question\\\" and the \\\"BFC-discussion\\\".[167] An example was consequently made out of referee Stumpf. He was permanently banned from refereeing by the DFV.[165] The sanctions against Stumpf were approved by Honecker and Krenz in the SED Central Committee.[188][189] However, a previously unknown video recording of the match was published by Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk (MDR) in 2000. The video recording showed that the penalty was correctly awarded and that the sanctions against Stumpf were unjustified.[165][178][190]\\n\\n\\\"I can imagine there was referee manipulation due to the immense pressure from the government and Ministry for State Security. That could have made some referees nervous and influenced their decisions. But we were the strongest team at the time. We didn\'t need their help.\\\"\\n\\nFalko Götz[191]\\nThe benefit of controlling important matches in Western Europe might have put indirect pressure on the referees to take preventive measures, in so-called preventive obedience.[192][193][194][195][175] In order pursue an international career, a referee would need a travel permit, confirmed by the Stasi.[188][181][196] It become known after the German reunification that several referees had also been Unofficial collaborators (IM) of the Stasi.[167][197][198][199] However, there is no evidence to show that referees were under direct instructions from the Stasi and no document has ever been found in the archives that gave the Stasi a mandate to bribe referees.[197][194][200][201]\\n\\nThe picture that the success of BFC Dynamo relied upon referee bias is dismissed by former BFC Dynamo players and coaches. Some of them admit that there might have been cases of referee bias, but they all insist that it was the thoroughness of their youth work and the quality of their play that earned them their titles.[202][174][191][203] Former coach Jürgen Bogs has said: \\\"You cannot postpone 26 matches in one season in the DDR-Oberliga. At that time we had the best football team\\\".[204][190][nb 6] BFC Dynamo was able to filter the best talents through nationwide screening and train them in its youth academy. The youth academy had full-time trainers employed for every age group.[206] As a trainer of the DDR-Oberliga team, Bogs worked with modern training methods, such as video evalutations, which was not yet common in East Germany. The club also applied heart rate and lactate measurements during training, which only came to the Bundesliga many years later.[207][190] Former referee Bernd Heynemann has concluded: \\\"The BFC is not ten times champions because the referees only whistled for Dynamo. They were already strong as a bear.\\\"[208]\\n\\nLast titles in East Germany (1986–1989)\\n\\nMarco Köller (left) and Heiko Scholz of 1.

Hansa Rostock for of the 1986–87 season.[209] Doll and Andreas Thom would form one of the most effective attacking duos in East German football in the late 1980s. BFC Dynamo defeated 1. FC Union Berlin 8–1 in the derby on the fourth matchday of the 1986-87 DDR-Oberliga.[210][211] The East Germany U19 team won the 1986 UEFA European Under-18 Championship, after defeating Italy 3–1 in the final on 15 October 1986. BFC Dynamo was represented by two youth players in the squad: midfielder Marco Köller and defender Hendrik Herzog.[212] [213] Köller and Herzog would then make their debuts for BFC Dynamo in the DDR-Oberliga during the 1986–87 season.[214][215] The team met fierce competition from 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig in the 1986–87 DDR-Oberliga. BFC Dynamo met 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig away on the 20th matchday at the Bruno-Plache-Stadion on 11 April 1987.[216] The two teams had the same number of points going into the match.[217] BFC Dynamo won the match 1–3.[216] The team eventually finished the 1986-87 DDR-Oberliga in first place, 6 points ahead of runner-up SG Dynamo Dresden and 8 points ahead of third-placed 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig.[218]\\n\\n\\nAndreas Thom during a match against SG Dynamo Dresden on 6 April 1988.\\nBFC Dynamo was eliminated in the first round of the 1987-88 European Cup after double defeats against FC Girondins de Bordeaux. Also the 1987-88 DDR-Oberliga meant firece competition from 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig. BFC Dynamo finished the first half of the season as Herbstmeister. The team had the same number of points as second-placed 1. FC Lokomotiv Leipzig and led the league only on goal difference.[219] Andreas Thom was the top scorer in the league by a wide margin, with 14 goals in 13 games in the first half of the season.[220] The second half of the 1987-88 DDR-Oberliga was a tight race against 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig until the end. BFC Dynamo and 1. FC Lokomotive were level on points heading into the final matchday, but BFC Dynamo had the better goal difference.[221] BFC Dynamo defeated FC Vorwärts Frankfurt 1–0 at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark on the final matchday and won its tenth consecutive DDR-Oberliga title. The winning goal was scored by Burkhard Reich.[222] The team then defeated FC Carl Zeiss Jena 2–0 in front of 40,000 spectators at the Stadion der Weltjugend in the final of the 1987–88 FDGB-Pokal and finally completed the Double.[223] Andreas Thom was eventually voted the 1988 East German footballer of the year.[224]\\n\\n\\nAndreas Thom receiving the 1988 East German footballer of the year award from the Die Neue Fußballwoche (de) editor-in-chief Jürgen Nöldner on 13 August 1988.\\nLong-time club president Manfred Kirste was replaced by Herbert Krafft ahead of the 1988–89 season.[225] Krafft had a background in the Volkspolizei.[226] BFC Dynamo was drawn against West German champions SV Werder Bremen in the first round of the 1988-89 European Cup. The first match was played at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark. Among the spectators was the former West German Chancellor Willy Brandt. BFC Dynamo sensationally won the match 3–0.[227] Bodo Rudwaleit was a match hero, with numerous saves.[228] However, the team lost the return leg at the Weser-Stadion with 5–0. The return leg in Bremen would become known as the second \\\"Miracle on the Weser\\\".[228][227] It has been rumored that the spectacular loss in the return leg was explained by BFC Dynamo having been given doping before the home game in East Berlin.[105][229] A more likely explanation, however, is that the players could not cope with the enormous pressure before the return leg.[229] It has also been rumored that the players were distracted from their pre-match preparations by shopping opportunities, which had been arranged by SV Werder Bremen manager Willi Lemke.[229][230] BFC Dynamo lost important points to its league rivals in the autumn and finished the first half of the season in fourth place, a full nine points behind SG Dynamo Dresden. It was the team\'s worst result after a first half of the season in the league in 14 years.[231]\\n\\nAverage attendance had dropped from 15,000 to 9,000 during the team\'s most successful years in the 1980s.[173] Ordinary fans feared the Stasi and had become disillusioned with political interference. Particularly aggravating were the restrictions on ticket sales that the Stasi imposed at international matches for political reasons. Only a few tickets were sold to ordinary fans for matches in the European Cup against opponents such as Hamburger SV and SV Werder Bremen. The majority was instead sold to a politically hand-picked audience.[190][232] BFC Dynamo also saw the emergence of a well-organized hooligan scene during the 1980s.[174][178] The development was partly a response to the increasing state repression against the supporter scene.[190]\\n\\n\\nThe team celebrates the victory in the 1988-89 FDGB-Pokal at the Stadion der Weltjugend on 1 April 1989.\\nBFC Dynamo met local rival 1. FC Union Berlin on the 16th matchday of the 1988-89 DDR-Oberliga on 18 March 1989. 1. FC Union Berlin now fielded as many as four former BFC Dynamo players in the starting line-up: Olaf Seier, Mario Maek, Thomas Grether and Norbert Trieloff.[233] BFC Dynamo reached the final of the FDGB-Pokal for the second consecutive season. The team met Karl-Marx-Stadt in the final of the 1988-89 FDGB-Pokal. BFC Dynamo won the match 1–0 in front of 35,000 spectators at the Stadion de Weltjugend and captured its second consecutive cup title. The winning goal was scored by Anderas Thom in the 57th minute.[234] BFC Dynamo eventually finished the 1988-89 DDR-Oberliga as runner-up.

The match was played at the Stadion der Freundschaft in Cottbus on 5 August 1989.[238] BFC Dynamo won the match 4-1 and thus became the first and only winner of the DFV-Supercup in the history of East German football.\\n\\nGerman reunification and decline (1989–2004)\\nMain article: History of Berliner FC Dynamo (1989–2004)\\nThe Peaceful revolution, FC Berlin and failed promotion (1989–1991)\\n\\nThe new BFC Dynamo coach Helmut Jäschke during the match against FC Rot-Weiß Erfurt on the first matchday of the 1989-90 DDR-Oberliga on 12 August 1989\\nThe 1989–90 season was tumultuous for BFC Dynamo. Frank Pastor was transferred to BSG Aktivist Schwarze Pumpe at the beginning of the season. BFC Dynamo was qualified for the 1989–90 European Cup Winners\' Cup as winners of the 1988–89 FDGB-Pokal. The team was eliminated in the second round by AS Monaco on the away goals rule. Coach Helmut Jäschke then decided to place young goalkeeper Oskar Kosche in the following match. Long-time goalkeeper Bodo Rudwaleit ten suddenly announced his immediate retirement from football.[239] The East German regime faltered under pressure from political mass demonstrations and events in neighboring countries. Parts of the Berlin Wall were opened on 9 November 1989 and East German citizens could now freely travel to West Berlin. The Stasi was transformed into the Office for National Security (German: Amt für Nationale Sicherheit) (AfNS) on 17 November 1989.[240] The transformation also ended the tenure of Erich Mielke as Minister of State Security.[241] He would soon be dismissed as the First Chairman of SV Dynamo as well.[242][226] Andreas Thom was signed to Bayer Leverkusen by Bayer Leverkusen manager Reiner Calmund. The transfer became official on 12 December 1989. Thom thus became the first player in the DDR-Oberliga to leave for the West German Bundesliga.[243] The transfer fee amounted to 2,5 million Deutsche Mark.[243]\\n\\n\\nThe team of FC Berlin at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark on 23 February 1990.\\nBodo Rudwaleit was transferred to BSG Stahl Einsenhüttenstadt and Bernd Schulz to BSG Bergmann-Borsig during the 1989–1990 winter break. The dismantling of the team from the 1980s was now well underway.[244] Coach Jäschke was dismissed during the winter break and was replaced by Peter Rohde.[245] Rohde had played 159 league- and 14 international matches for BFC Dynamo between 1969 and 1978 and was an older brother of team captain Frank Rohde.[245] The AfNS was eventually completely dissolved on 13 January 1990.[240] With the dissolution of the Stasi, BFC Dynamo had lost a major sponsor. The Ministry of the Interior announced that it was only prepared to support the club until the end of the 1989–90 season.[246][247][248] The fate of the club was uncertain. BFC Dynamo was rebranded as FC Berlin on 19 February 1990.[249][250] Club President Herbert Krafft was dismissed at the same time and Jürgen Bogs took over as interim president until new club elections could be held.[249] The team participated in the first edition of the indoor tournament \\\"Internationales Berliner Hallenfussballurnier\\\" in the Werner-Seelenbinder-Halle. Teams from West Berlin, such as Hertha BSC also participated. FC Berlin lost the final against arch-rival 1. FC Union Berlin with 4–5. Thomas Doll became the best goal scorer of the tournament with 12 goals.[251] The second half of the season started well, but it soon became clear that FC Berlin would not would not have a chance at the title.[252] FC Berlin finished the 1989-90 DDR-Oberliga in fourth place and failed for the first time in a long time to qualify for a European tournament.[253] Attendance dropped from 7,271 in the fall of 1989 to just 3,383 in the spring of 1990.[254] The team lost Thomas Doll and Frank Rohde to Hamburger SV and Rainer Ernst to 1. FC Kaiserslautern after the season.[255][256]\\n\\n\\nDirk Rehbein chasing the ball during a match between FC Berlin and HFC Chemie at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark on 10 November 1990.\\nThe team was joined by Dirk Rehbein from SC Fortuna Köln during the summer of 1990. FC Berlin participated in the 1990 Intertoto Cup 30 June 1990 and 17 July 1990. FC Berlin had sold off almost all its offensive players during the 1989–90 season and the team finished the tournament in third place.[257][258][259] FC Berlin also recruited Mikhail Pronichev from FC Lokomotiv Moscow for the 1990–91 season.[260][261] The team began the 1990-91 NOFV-Oberliga with four consecutive defeats and was in last place in the league after the fourth matchday. Jürgen Bogs returned as coach.[262][263] A wave of hooliganism swept through East Germany in 1990.[178] One of the largest hooligan scenes in Germany was formed around FC Berlin.[253] 18-year-old FC Berlin supporter Mike Polley was shot dead by police during riots in Leutzsch in connection with the match between FC Sachsen Leipzig and FC Berlin on 3 November 1990. The police had fired between 50 and 100 shots in one minute.[264] The hooligan scene of FC Berlin would shape the entire 1990–91 season.[265] FC Berlin continued to struggle in the second half of the league season. The team was in 12th place in the league towards the end of the season.[266] However, FC Berlin won its last two matches in the league, against Chemnitzer FC and FC Victoria 91 Frankfurt, and finished the 1990-91 NOFV-Oberliga in 11th place.[266] The team was thus qualified for the play-off for the 2. Bundesliga. FC Berlin was one point behind leaders BSV Stahl Brandeburg before the final round. The team defeated 1. FC Magdeburg 3–5 away, but BSV Stahl Brandenburg defeated 1. FC Union Berlin 0–2 away. FC Berlin thus finished in second place and just narrowly failed to qualify for the 2. Bundesliga.[267][268][257] The team lost several key-players after the season, such as Heiko Bonan, Burkhard Reich, Waldemar Ksienzyk, Thorsten Boer, Eike Küttner and Hendrik Herzog.[268][269]\\n\\nDecline (1991-1994)\\nFC Berlin recruited midfielder Ralf Rambow from Eisenhüttenstädter FC Stahl for the 1991–92 season. The 1991–92 season was the first season when teams from East Germany and teams from West Germany played in the same league system. The NOFV-Oberliga was now at third tier in the league system. FC Berlin was qualified for the 1991-92 DFB-Pokal as a participant in the 1990–91 2. Bundesliga play-off. It was the club\'s first participation in the DFB-Pokal. The team was drawn against SC Freiburg. The starting eleven included players such as Oskar Kosche, Christian Backs, Jens-Uwe Zöphel, Jörg Fügner, Mario Tolkmitt and Mikhail Pronichev. FC Berlin lost the match 0–2.[270] Heiko Brestrich returned to the team during the summer of 1991.[271] Brestrich would be a key-player of FC Berlin in the 1990s. FC Berlin came to dominate the 1991-92 NOFV-Oberliga. The team lost only two matches during the entire league season and scored a total of 97 goals.[272] FC Berlin was once again qualified for the play-off for the 2. Bundesliga. The team finished the play-off in third place. Volkswagen-backed VfL Wolfsburg won the play-off, which meant that no team from the former East Germany was able to advance.[272] FC Berlin lost 11 players after the 1991–92 season, including Mario Tolkmitt, Christian Backs, Jörn Lenz, Jörg Fügner and Oskar Kosche.[273][274] In total, FC Berlin lost two complete teams in the first one or two years after the fall of the Berlin Wall.[256]\\n\\nFailing to win win promotion to the 2. Bundesliga, FC Berlin had to continue at amateur level. The main competitors in the following seasons of the NOFV-Oberliga Nord were teams such as Tennis Borussia Berlin, BSV Stahl Brandenburg and Eisenhüttenstädter FC Stahl. With the many player departures after the 1991–92 season, Jürgen Bogs once again had to build a new team.[273] FC Berlin recruited forward Bernd Jopek for 1. FC Union Berlin and midfielder Stefan Oesker from Blau-Weiß 1890 Berlin for the 1992–93 season.[273] The team was also strengthened by a number of youth players.[273] FC Berlin now had to rely on its youth department to supply the team with new players.[275] The team finished the 1992-93 NOFV-Oberliga Nord in fourth place. Dirk Rehbein and Ralf Rambow left for 1. FC Union Berlin after the season.[276][277] FC Berlin was no longer the absolute treasure trove among former East German clubs, but continued to produce talent thanks to its excellent youth work.[277] Among the players from the youth department on the squad in 1993–94 season were Jens Reckmann, Mike Jesse, Ronny Nikol, Michael Franke, Marcell Fensch and Rayk Schröder.[278][275][273][276][277] The team of FC Berlin that played against Spandauer SV on the fifth matchday on 9 September 1993 had an avagerage age of only 21,33 and was the youngest team of BFC Dynamo to have ever played a competitive match.[279] Helmut Koch replaced Jürgen Bogs as coach on 28 September 1993.[280] FC Berlin finished the 1993-94 NOFV-Oberliga Nord in fourth place and qualified for the new Regionalliga Nordost.\\n\\nRegionalliga Nordost and first Berlin cup title (1994–1999)\\nMario Kallnik returned to the club for the 1994–95 season. The re-instated Regionalliga would now form the new third tier in the German football league system. The 1994-95 Regionalliga Nordost meant new meetings with well-known opponents such as FC Carl Zeiss Jena, 1. FC Union Berlin and FC Rot-Weiß Erfurt.[281] BFC Dynamo struggled in the 1994-95 Regionalliga Nordost, but managed to retain its place in the league.[282] Jens-Uwe Zöphel left the team for FC Energie Cottbus after the season. The team was joined by goalkeeper Daniel Bartel from the youth department for the 1995–96 season. Bartel became the new first-choice goalkeeper at the beginning of the season. The highlights of the 1995-96 Regionalliga Nordost were new meetings with old rival 1. FC Dynamo Dresden.[283] The two teams had not met since the 1990–91 season.[284][281] The first meeting was played in front of 2,002 spectators at the Stadion im Sportforum on 8 September 1995. The score was 1–3 at half break.[283] The match ended 4–3 to 1. FC Dynamo Dresden.[284][281] Club President Klaus Bittroff resigned on 14 September 1995 and Vice president Volkmar Wanski became the new club president.[285] The team had a difficult start to the 1995-95 Regionalliga Nordost. Due to acute danger of relegation, coach Koch was dismissed on 17 October 1995. Werner Voigt became the new coach.[286][287] Voigt had a long background in the club as a player and coach. With Voigt, the experienced defender Mario Maek also returned to the club.[286] FC Berlin organized one of the biggest youth football tournaments so far in the eastern part of the country in the Sportforum Hohenschönhausen on 6–8 April 1996. As many as 30 youth teams from clubs such as Chelsea F.C., Everton F.C., Feyenoord, FC Bayern München and Borussia Dortmund participated.[288][287] FC Berlin found itself in the relegation zone towards the end of the 1995-95 Regionalliga Nordost.[289] The place in the league was saved with a 1–0 win over FSV Wacker 90 Nordhausen on the 33rd matchday, 19 May 1996. The winning goal was scored by Mario Maek.[283]\\n\\nExperienced players such as Heiko Brestrich, Mario Maek, and Jens Reckmann would form the team\'s backbone during the 1996–67 season.[290] FC Berlin defeated 1. FC Dynamo Dresden 2–0 in the opening match of the 1996–97 Regionalliga Nordost in front of 2,300 spectators at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark.[291] Then followed a sharp decline.[292] The team would lose 6–0 away to its other rival 1. FC Union on the ninth matchday.[293] It was the biggest loss to date against 1. FC Union Berlin.[294] Club President Wanski announced on 26 November 1996 that the financial reserves had been used up.[287] The millions of Deutsche Mark that the club had made from player transfers in the early 1990s were now gone.[295] Wanski would then support the club every year with personal contributions.[296][297] During the second half of the 1995–96 season, he became shirt sponsor with his own company Regio Bautenschutz GmbH.[290] The shirts had not had a sponsor in almost seven years.[290] FC Berlin also signed a two-year sponsoring contract with the Italian sportswear manufacturer Fila during the spring of 1996, where Fila became the club\'s equipment sponsor. The club previously had no equipment sponsor.[298] Fila had reportedly been impressed by the club\'s youth work.[298] FC Berlin finished the 1996-67 Regionaliga Nordost on 13th place after another weak season. Mikhail Pronichev left the team for TuS Makkabi Berlin and Jens Reckmann for 1. FC Dynamo Dresden after the season.\\n\\nThe team recruited Croatian defender Davor Krznarić for the 1997–98 season. The 1997-98 Regionalliga Nordost was also a struggle, with the team in 12th place in the league at the winter break.[299] The club still received New Year\'s greetings from Real Madrid and Liverpool F.C. in 1997.[300] Experienced defender Jörn Lenz returned to the club during the winter break.[301] Lenz would be a key player for several seasons to come. The successes in the Regionalliga Nordost had not materialized. It became known that coach Voigt had signed for 1. FC Dynamo Dresden for the 1998–99 season. The club and Voigt decided to part ways.[302] Assistant coach Ingo Rentzsch took over on 12 March 1998.[303] The team played an exciting 5–5 draw away against 1. FC Magdeburg away on the 33rd matchday, 5 May 1998. Bernd Jopek, Jörn Lenz, Davor Krznarić, Marek Seruga, and Mario Kallnik scored one goal each in the match.[303][304] New coach for the 1998–99 season was Henry Häusler.[305] Players central to the team in the 1998–99 season were Heiko Brestrich, Jörn Lenz, Mario Maek, Martino Gatti, Mario Kallnik, Davor Krznarić, Timo Lesch, and Sven Ohly, with Lenz as team captain.[305][306] Coach Häusler was eventually dismissed on 18 March 1999 and assistant coach Ingo Rentzsch again took over as interim coach.[307] Club President Wanski came up with the idea to revive the old name BFC Dynamo during the autumn of 1998. He said: \\\"We stand by Dynamo\'s sporting tradition, we reject the club\'s political past.\\\"[308][297] An overwhelming majority at the general meeting on 8 May 1999 voted to take back the old name.[309] The team met local rival Union Berlin on the penultimate matchday of the 1998-99 Regionalliga Nordost, 8 May 1999. The team now again competed as BFC Dynamo. Coach Rentzsch threw in the towel at half-time and left the stadium, allegedly because Club President Wanski had wanted to dictate the line-up.[310][311][312] Youth trainer Norbert Paepke took over as coach in the second half of the match.[310][313] BFC Dynamo won the derby 2–0 with two goals by Marcel Solomo in front of 2,543 spectators at the Stadion an der Alten Försterei.[314] BFC Dynamo reached the final of the 1998-99 Berlin Cup. The team defeated Berlin Türkspor 1965 with 4–1 in the final on 11 May 1999 and finally won its first Berlin Cup title. Ayhan Gezen and Mario Maek scored one goal each, and Heiko Brestrich scored two goals for BFC Dynamo in the final.[315]\\n\\nRelegation to NOFV-Oberliga and crash (1999–2001)\\nBFC Dynamo recruited goalkeeper Nico Thomaschewski for the 1999–2000 season. Thomaschewski became the new first-choice goalkeeper. Torsten Boer, Jens Reckmann and Dirk Rehbein also returned to the club.[316][317] The team was also joined by forward Marcel Riediger from the youth department. Marcel Riediger was the son of former BFC Dynamo striker Hans-Jürgen Riediger.[318][319] The team lost 0–2 to Arminia Bielefeld the first round of the 1999-2000 DFB-Pokal.[320] BFC Dynamo defeated SG Dynamo Dresden 1–0 on the sixth matchday.[316] The team stood at a sensational second place in the league after the eight matchday, but then followed a sharp descline.[321][322] BFC Dynamo suffered a period of crisis during the autumn of 1999.[323] The financial difficulties had continued. The number of sponsors was too few and the club was financially dependent on Club President Volkmar Wanski. The number of spectators also remained low and new sponsors were deterred by hooliganism.[311] The team went through several league matches without a single win. Heiko Brestrich eventually rebelled against coach Klaus Goldbach in early November 1999 and was suspended. He was then sacked and transferred to VfB Leipzig.[324][325][326][327] Brestrich was very popular with the supporters of BFC Dynamo and was popularly called \\\"Heiko Brestrich - Football God\\\" (German: Heiko Brestrich - Fußballgott).[324][328] He had played a total of 301 matches for BFC Dynamo during his career, including 282 matches between 1991 and 1999.[324][329] The team was joined by Russian striker Denis Kozlov later the same month. Kozlov would eventually prove successful at BFC Dynamo. Coach Goldbach was eventually dismissed in early December 1999 and Jürgen Bogs returned for his third stint as coach.[330]\\n\\nThe club finally got a promising main sponsor in the form of the software company Lipro AG at the beginning of 2000.[331][332] However, the difficulties in the league continued and the club\'s liabilities had already started to become significant.[332] BFC Dynamo finished the 1999-2000 Regionalliga Nordost in 17th place and was relegated to the NOFV-Oberliga Nord. For the first time in its history, BFC Dynamo was now a fourth tier team.[333] BFC Dynamo reached the final of the Berlin Cup for a second consecutive season, but lost the final of the 1999-2000 Berlin Cup 2–0 against the reserve team of Tennis Borussia Berlin.[334] Club President Wanski resigned on 29 June 2000.[335][336][337] The reason was allegedly that the sponsor Lipro AG demanded greater influence in club decision making.[335][336] The club was now temporary in the hands of Sports director Hans Reker.[335] Mario Maek retired as a player after the 1999–2000 season and several players left the team, including Thorsten Boer and Martino Gatti.[335][336] A new team was put together for the 2000-01 NOFV-Oberliga Nord. The budget for the season was 2.3 million Deutsche Mark, which set new record for the NOFV-Oberliga Nord.[336] The team was joined by striker Dirk Vollmar, Cameroonian midfielder Aka Adek Mba, Brazilian midfielder Alexandre Vieira dos Santos, nicknamed \\\"Macalé\\\", as well as five Romanian players: Dănuț Oprea, Silvian Cristescu, Aurel Panait, Dorel Zegrean, and Florin Bătrânu.[336][338] SPD-politician Karin Halsch became new club president on 27 September 2000.[339][340][nb 7] BFC Dynamo dominated the 2000-01 NOFV-Oberliga Nord. The team was drawn against arch-rival 1. FC Union Berlin in the quarter-finals of the 2000-01 Berlin Cup The match was played in front of 4,427 spectators at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark on 24 March 2001. BFC Dynamo lost 3–0.[341] Serious riots broke out after the match when BFC Dynamo supporters clashed with the police.[342] The team finished the 2000-01 NOFV-Oberliga in first place, with only three losses in 34 matches.[343] Denis Kozlov had scored a wopping 29 goals for BFC Dynamo in the league.[343] The team would now face 1. FC Magdeburg in a play-off for promotion to the Regionalliga Nord.\\n\\nHowever, it had become apparent that the club had serious financial problems two weeks before the play-offs. Players and coaches had received their January salaries in March and had not received any salaries since. The club was also behind with insurance payments.[344][345][346] The German Football Association (DFB) demanded that the club could provide a bank guarantee of 4.2 million Deutsche Mark to secure the budget for the possible 2001–02 Regionalliga Nord. It was already clear before the first match in the play-offs that the club would have difficulty meeting the requirements of the DFB in the event of promotion.[343][347] The first match of the play-offs ended 0–0 in front of 8,282 spectators at the Stadion im Sportforum on 2 June 2001.[348] The second match was played at the Ernst-Grube-Stadion in Magdeburg on 9 June 2001. Around 2,000 supporters from BFC Dynamo traveled to the second match.[349][350] The score was 2–2 at half time. BFC Dynamo was practically promoted at this point.[348] However, the team ultimately lost the match 2–5.[348][351] The club\'s debts were now estimated at 1.5 million Deutsche Mark.[352] And now, also the main sponsor Lipro AG was in financial trouble.[353][354] Several players left the club directly after the 2000–01 season, including Marcel Riediger and Denis Kozlov.[343][352]\\n\\nInsolvency (2001–2002)\\nInsurance company AOK filed for insolvency against BFC Dynamo on 21 June 2001. The company demanded 126,000 Deutsche Mark in unpaid insurance payments.[355] Club President Karin Halsch resigned on 25 June 2001.[355] There had been major discrepancies between Halsch and sports director Hans Reker regarding how the situation should be resolved.[355] Reker took over as acting president.[356] Supporters of BFC Dynamo started the fundraiser \\\"Save BFC Dynamo\\\" (German: Rettet den BFC). The fundraiser quickly succeeded in raising 40,000 Euros.[357][358][359] More players left the team during the summer of 2001, including Mario Kallnik and Aka Adeck Mba.[360] The debts were estimated at 5 millions Deutsche Mark, of which 4.2 million were loans from Lipro AG and 1.3 short-term debts, at this point.[361] The club tried to initiate a partnership with FC Dynamo Moscow, in which BFC Dynamo would serve as a farm team for FC Dynamo Moscow in Europe.[362] But the plan led nowhere.[363] A preliminary insolvency administrator was appointed at the end of August 2001.[364] It was estimated that insolvency proceedings could be opened on 1 November 2001.[365] Insolvency proceedings were opened against main sponsor Lipro AG on 5 October 2001.[366]\\n\\nThe preliminary insolvency administrator estimated the club\'s debts at 6 million Deutsche Mark.[367] BFC Dynamo needed 30,000 Deutsche Mark by 31 October 2001 in order to commence insolvency proceedings.[368] However, the club did not have the money.[369] Discussions with new sponsors failed.[370] If insolvency proceedings could not be opened, the club would go bankrupt and have to restart in the Kreisliga under a new name.[363][365][371][368] Supporters organized a demonstration that marched from the Sportforum Hohenschönhausen to the Rotes Rathaus. Also former players such as Hans-Jürgen Riediger, Rainer Troppa, Waldemar Ksienzyk and Heiko Brestrich planned to participate. The demonstration was received at the Rotes Rathaus by former club president and SPD-politician Halsch.[369][372][368] A group of sponsors around former president Volkmar Waski finally came forward and offered the money required to commence insolvency proceedings.[373][374] The club\'s entire presidium resigned on 31 October 2001.[375][337] An emergency board formed by André Sommer, Rayk Bernt and press spokesman Holger Zimmermann was appointed by the club\'s Economic Council.[376][370]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo is said to have made millions on player sales after Die Wende.[356][377][378] The club was for a time considered the richest amateur club in Germany.[295] But not all the money had went to the club, some had also went to SV Dynamo, DFV and advisers.[379][380] The club\'s reputation as the former Stasi club made it difficult to win new sponsors.[296][381][356][382] The club was also plagued by hooliganism, which repeatedly caused negative headlines.[382][340] FC Berlin failed to qualify for the 2. Bundesliga and never progressed beyond the third tier of the German football league system.[383] The number of spectators was only a couple of hundred per match in the early 1990s and the income from membership fees was marginal.[382][383] The club also maintained a large youth department which at one point cost about 400,000 Deutsche Mark per year.[382] At the end of 1996, the club still had no debts, but also no money left in its bank accounts.[296] President Wanski would then have to support the club with his own financial contributions.[296] It is estimated that Wanski invested an estimated 3 million Deutsche Mark of private money in the club over the five years before his resignation.[384] BFC Dynamo finally got a promising new sponsor in the form of Lipro AG in early 2000. Millions of Deutsche Mark would now be available.[385] But the club\'s liabilites had already started to become significant.[385] The club made a bid to reach the third tier Regionalliga Nord, and sports director Hans Reker started signing new players.[385] However, the millions from sponsor Lipro AG would later turn out to be loans.[385]\\n\\nThe emergency board was considered to represent the interest of the sponsor group around Wanski.[386] André Sommer and Rayk Bernt were controversial due to their membership in the Hells Angels.[387] However, both were also long-time supporters; Sommer had been a member of the hooligan scene back in the 1980s.[388][389] Zimmermann resigned from the emergency board on 23 November 2001, as he thought Sommer and Berndt had given the club an image he could not identify with.[390] A new presidium was due to be elected at a general meeting on 26 November 2001.[337] But the general meeting was converted into an \\\"information event\\\" by a vote of 87 to 59, at the insistence of the emergency board.[390][391] Some club members felt they had been blackmailed.[391] Sommer and Bernt continued to lead the club during the opening of the insolvency proceedings, but the legitimacy of their presidium was questioned.[390]\\n\\nInsolvency proceedings were opened on 1 November 2001.[392][393][394] BFC Dynamo was thus automatically relegated to the Verbandsliga Berlin.[372] All contracts with professionals and employees were terminated.[372][395][396][393] The club now had to continue under amateur conditions, the players could only be offered 300 Euros per month.[369][337] Only three players from the original squad remained for the first mandatory friendly match, one of them was team captain Piotr Rowicki.[397][337] Jörn Lenz left for VfB Leipzig and Nico Thomaschewski for SV Babelsberg 03.[337] Coach Jürgen Bogs also decided not to continue.[374][398] Former assistant coach Mario Maek stepped in as the new coach on a voluntary basis, assisted by goalkeeping coach Bodo Rudwaleit.[398] The club once again had to rely on its youth players.[399]\\n\\nSommer and Bernt met great opposition due to their membership in the Hells Angels.[400] The duo had a deterrent effect and failed to attract new sponsors.[388][401] Supporters collected signatures to elect a new presidium.[388][402] But the signatures were ignored by Sommer and Berndt.[388][402] The former coach of the women\'s team Volkmar Lucius then took legal action for violation of the statutes.[388][402] The Sommer and Bernt presidium was then finally overthrown by supporters and Lucius, through a successful application to the Charlottenburg District Court.[388][402][401] The court appointed Lucius as an emergency board member on 30 April 2002.[388][403] Sommer and Bernt had, after all, helped make sure that the insolvency proceedings could be opened by their personal financial contributions.[402][404] But the duo would no longer have much say in the club after 2003.[405] The interest group IG BFC\'er managed to persuade entrepreneur Mike Peters to become the new club president.[401][404] Peters was elected as the new president on 31 May 2002.[406] The preferential claims of 204,000 Euros looked insurmountable.[401] But the supporters had negotiated with creditors and received numerous waivers.[401][407] They had also set up a donations account and collected at least 13,800 Euros themselves.[407][406] The new presidum around Peters would also contribute 100,000 Euros from private money to the insolvency plan.[406][401][407] Peters also committed to funding a large part of the budget for the 2002-03 Verbandsliga Berlin.[406][408]\\n\\nRestart in Verbandsliga Berlin and end of insolvency (2002–2004)\\nFormer BFC Dynamo player Dirk Vollmar became the new coach for the 2002–03 season.[406] Bodo Rudwaleit continued as assistant coach.[406] Nico Thomaschewski and Aka Adeck Mba returned for the 2002–03 season.[409][410] The team was also joined by defender Robert Rudwaleit from the reserve team.[411][408][412] Robert Rudwaleit was the son of Bodo Rudwaleit and had made his first few appearances with the first team during the previous season.[413] BFC Dynamo defeated the reserve team of 1. FC Union Berlin in both meetings in 2002-03 Verbandsliga Berlin.[414] The team eventuallty finished its first season in the Verbandsliga Berlin in third place.[414] The insolvency situation was complex. The club had about 170 creditors. It was still unclear whether the insolvency proceedings could be successful.[415]\\n\\nJörn Lenz returned to the club for the 2003–04 season.[416] BFC Dynamo also recruited striker Danny Kukulies from SC Pfullendorf for the season. Kukulies had a long background in the youth department of BFC Dynamo.[417] BFC Dynamo was in third place after the first half of the season, nine points behind BFC Preussen and six points behind second placed SV Tasmania Gropiusstadt 73.[418] The team defeated SV Tasmania Gropiusstadt 73 2–1 in the first league match after the winter break, with one goal by Lenz and one goal by Robert Rudwaleit.[419] The team would also win the following matches.[420] BFC Dynamo eventually finished the 2003-04 Verbandsliga Berlin in first place and won promotion back to the NOFV-Oberliga Nord. The team had won all 17 matches in the second half of the league season, which set new record in the Verbandsliga Berlin.[421] Danny Kukulies scored 32 goals and Tomasz Suwary 22 goals in the 2003-04 Verbandsliga Berlin.[422] The insolvency proceedings would finally come to a positive conclusion after a meeting with the creditors at the Charlottenburg District Court on 8 June 8, 2004. The 192 creditors received an insolvency rate of 0.25 percent.[423][422] The insolvency proceedings were then finally declared closed by the Charlottenburg District Court on 16 June 2004, after one complaint was dismissed.[424]\\n\\nConsolidation, Regionalliga Nordost and Berlin Cup success (2004-present)\\nMain article: History of Berliner FC Dynamo (2004–present)\\nConsolidation (2004-2010)\\nMario Weinkauf was elected as new club president at the annual meeting on 18 June 2004. His vision for BFC Dynamo was a club that was \\\"managed seriously from a sporting and financial perspective\\\".[425][426] Former professional player Christian Backs became the new coach for the 2004–05 season.[427] Central players in the team in the 2004–05 season were Robert Rudwaleit, Nico Thomaschewski, Dennis Kutrieb, Jörn Lenz, Danny Kukulies and Tomasz Suwary.[428][429] There were several outbreaks of riots and hooliganism among the supporters of BFC Dynamo during the season.[430][431] The club management decided not to apply for a license to the Regionalliga Nordost despite the team being in third place in the league at the start of the second half of the season.

BFC Dynamo was debt-free ahead of the 2005–06 season.[435] BFC Dynamo negotiated a lucrative sponsorship agreement with the energy company United Sol Energy. The company\'s representative in Berlin was the Belgian former FC Bayern Munich goalkeeper Jean-Marie Pfaff.[436][435][437] The plan also included the founding of a new youth sports school at BFC Dynamo that would bear Pfaff\'s name.[437] New riots broke out among supporters in connection with the match against SV Yeşilyurt on first matchday of the 2005-06 NOFV-Oberliga Nord on 5 August 2005. As many as 13 police officers were injured in the riots.[438][439] The 2005-05 NOFV-Oberliga Nord involved new derbies against 1. FC Union Berlin.

Coach Piepenberg was dismissed after the match.[442]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo came to play with the logo of United Sol Energy on their shirts at the beginning of the season, despite the fact that the club had yet to receive any money.[443][444] It eventually became clear that there would be no money from United Sol Energy.[445][446] Club spokesman Yiannis Kaufmann resigned from all posts in September 2005 due to disagreements over the club\'s policy regarding sponsors.

The anniversary was celebrated with a party for supporters with 750 guests.[452] The club management worked to ensure that the club would no longer be associated with hooligans and the far-right scene. The Israeli fashion brand JetLag became a new sponsor at the turn of the year and Weinkauf also planned a training camp in Israel.[453] The club decided not to extend the sponsorship agreements with several controversial sponsors at the beginning of 2006. The index included companies with links to Hells Angels.[453] The return match against 1.

BFC Dymamo lost 0–2 against FC Schalke 04 in front of 14,114 spectators at Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark on 14 August 2017. The attendance in the match was the highest attendance number for BFC Dynamo since the match between BFC Dynamo and AS Monaco in the 1989–90 European Cup Winners\' Cup at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark on 1 November 1989.[570][568] BFC Dynamo finished the 2017-18 Regionalliga Nordost in 4th place. The team had scored a total of 70 goals during the league season. Rufat Dadasov became the league\'s top scorer with 25 goals in 25 matches.[571] The team again reached the final of the Berlin Cup. BFC Dynamo defeated Berliner SC 2–1 in the final of the 2017-18 Berliner Cup on 21 May 2018 and captured its second consecutive Berlin Cup title.[572] Dadashow scored both goals for BFC Dynamo in the final.[573] Dadashow left the team for SC Preußen Munster and Matthias Steinborn for 1.

FC Magdeburg before the season.[585] The pre-season friendly against 1. FC Magdeburg was then a tradition since 12 years back.[585] The team was in fifth place before the winter break.[586] The league season was suspended at the beginning of the second half, due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. The virtual match was played at the no longer existing Stadion der Weltjugend.[587] BFC Dynamo arranged a virtual match against the fictional team FC Corona on 18 April 2020, to raise funds.[588] The club sold a total of 50,000 tickets for the match.[589] The 2019-20 regionaliga Nordost was eventually cancelled. The final league standing was decided by quotient rule. BFC Dynamo finished in sixth place. The team was joined by midfielder Alexander Siebeck from SV Babelsberg 03 for the 2020–21 season.[590] Mathias Steinborn also returned to the club.[591] Also the 2020-21 Regionalliga Nordost was suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[592][593] The team lost several players during the break. Also the 2020-21 Regionalliga Nordost was ultimately cancelled, and FC Viktoria 1889 Berlin was declared the winner.[594]\\n\\nHowever, the Berlin Football Association (BFV) decided that the 2020-21 Berlin Cup should be played out played out among the five remaining Regionalliga teams.[595][596] BFC Dynamo defeated the newly promoted FC Viktoria Berlin 3–0 in the semi-finals.[597] The team then defeated Berliner AK 07 2–1 in the final at the Mommsenstadion on 29 May 2021 and captured its seventh Berlin Cup title.[598] BFC Dynamo was joined by experienced center forward Christian Beck and Moldovan goalkeeper Dmitri Stajila for the 2021–22 season.[599][600] Central central players in the team were Christian Beck, Dmitri Stajila, Chris Reher, Alexander Siebeck, Michael Blum, Andreas Pollasch, Joey Breitfeld, Darryl Guerts and Andor Bolyki during the 2021–22 season. The team defeated 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig 1–4 away in the opening match and then FC Energie Cottbus 2–1 at home on the second matchday of the 2021-22 Regionaliga Nordost.[601][602][603] BFC Dynamo was drawn against VfB Stuttgart in the first round of the 2021-22 DFB-Pokal. The match was played at Stadion im Sportforum. It was the first match in the DFB-Pokal at the Stadion im Sportforum since FC Berlin faced SC Freiburg at the stadium on 27 July 1991 in the 1991-92 DFB-Pokal.[270] BFC Dynamo lost the match 0–6 and was eliminated from the cup.[604] The team defeated VSG Altglienicke 2–0 at home on the 19th matchday and then Berliner AK 07 1–3 away on the 18th matchday. BFC Dynamo finished finished the first half of the league season as Herbstmeister.[605][606][607]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo saw the biggest increase in the number of club members among all clubs in Berlin in 2021, apart from Hertha BSC and 1. FC Union Belin. Membership of the club increased by 51 percent in 2021.[608] The team was joined by experience defender Sebastian Hertner during the winter break.[609][610] BFC Dynamo defeated Chemnitzer FC 1–3 away on the 31st matchday.[611] The team was now ten points ahead of second-placed VSG Altglienicke, as well as 11 points ahead of third-placed 1. FC Lokomotiv Lepzig and fourth-placed FC Carl Zeiss Jena. Afterwards, however, declining results followed. BFC Dynamo were six points behind second-placed FC Carl Zeiss Jena with two matchdays remaining, but the team had the best goal difference in the league by far.[612] FC Carl Zeiss Jena only had a theoretical chance to push BFC Dynamo off the top.[613] BFC Dynamo eventually finished the 2021-22 Regionaliga Nordost in first place and had finally captured its first ever Regionalliga title.[614] Christian Beck became the league top goalscorer with 23 goals.[615] The team faced VfB Oldenburg from Regionalliga Nord in the play-off for the 3. Liga.[614]\\n\\nIn order for BFC Dynamo to be able to get a license for the 3. Liga, the German Football Association (DFB) demanded that the club provide a massive guarantee of 900,000 Euros, as a security for the budget in the 3. Liga.[616] BFC Dynamo started a fundraiser to collect the amount. With the help of sponsors, supporters and Economic Council, the club managed to collect the amount.[617][618][619] BFC Dynamo lost the first play-off match 0–2 in front of 4,420 spectators at Sadion im Sportforum on 28 May 2022.[620] The second match was played at Marschweg-Stadion in Oldenburg on 4 June 2022. The score was 1–1 at half-time. Andor Bolyki finally managed to score 1-2 for BFC Dynamo in the 96th minute. BFC Dynamo tried everything, but failed to score a decisive third goal. The match ended 2–1 to BFC Dynamo, but VfB Oldenburg won the play-off on goal difference.[621][622] BFC Dynamo parted ways with coach Benbenneck after the season. The reason given was the stagnation at the end of the league season.[623] New coach for the 2022–23 season was Heiner Backhaus.[624]\\n\\nColours and crest\\nThe colours of BFC Dynamo are claret and white.[625] The colours were inherited from SC Dynamo Berlin and followed the claret colour scheme of SV Dynamo. BFC Dynamo has been playing in claret and white since the club\'s founding, with the exception of a period in the 1990s. The BFC Dynamo home kit has traditionally been a claret shirt, paired with claret or white shorts and socks. The team is occasionally nicknamed \\\"die Weinroten\\\", which means \\\"the Clarets\\\".[626][627]\\n\\nThe BFC Dynamo away kit has traditionally been a white shirt, paired with claret or white shorts and socks. However, the team used green away shirts from the end of the 1960s until the mid-1970s.[628][83] Green was the colour of the Volkspolizei, which was the official sponsor of BFC Dynamo during the East German era. The green away shirt was then exchanged for a white away shirt, paired with red or white shorts and socks.[93][99] The team used entirely red away kits during the 1981–82 and 1982–83 seasons.[629][630] The red away kit was then exchanged for a claret away kit.[631] The team again used white away shirts from the 1985–86 season.[632] The 1985–86 season also saw the instruction of a new claret and white diagonally striped away shirt.[632] The diagonally striped away shirt would be used for the rest of the 1980s.[237]\\n\\nThe club was rebranded as FC Berlin on 19 February 1990. A pure white was set as the new match colour with immediate effect.[633] FC Berlin then adopted a red and white colour scheme for the 1990–91 season.[634] In the eyes of the supporters, the red and white kit looked a lot like 1. FC Union Berlin.[634] The club played in red and white home kits for most of the FC Berlin era, but wore a black and red striped home shirt, paired with black shorts and socks from the 1996–97 season through the 1998–99 season. The club returned to its original club name on 3 May 1999 and consequently also later returned to its traditional colour scheme.[635]\\n\\n1966-1990, 1999–2009, 2023-\\n1966-1990, 1999–2009, 2023-\\n\\n \\n2009-2023\\n2009-2023\\n\\nThe crest of BFC Dynamo during the East German era featured a stylized \\\"D\\\" for SV Dynamo and the lettering \\\"BFC\\\" in red and yellow on a white background, surrounded by a yellow wreath.[636][637] BFC Dynamo abandoned its East German crest when the club was rebranded as FC Berlin on 19 February 1990.[638][639][636] The club used two different crests during the FC Berlin era. The first crest featured a stylized image of the roof of the Brandenburg Gate with the lettering \\\"FCB\\\" underneath and the club name \\\"Fussballclub Berlin\\\" in capital letters at the bottom, in white on a red background. It was only briefly used during the spring of 1990.[640] The second crest featured a stylized image of a football with the Brandenburg Gate in front, the lettering \\\"FCB\\\" at the top and the club name \\\"FC Berlin\\\" at the bottom, in red on a white background. This crest was used from the spring of 1990 until the end of the FC Berlin era.[640][284]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo reclaimed its East German crest when the club returned to its original club name on 3 May 1999.[639] But the club was no longer in possession of the crest.[639] The club had neglected to seek legal protection for its East German crest after German reunification. The neglect was likely due to managerial inexperience. Protection of trademarks was neither necessary nor common in East Germany.[636] The crest was now owned by Peter Klaus-Dieter Mager, commonly known as \\\"Pepe\\\". Pepe Mager was a famous fan of Hertha BSC and a fan merchandise dealer.[641] The club tried to recover the crest from Mager though court action, without success.[639][636] The ownership of the crest was instead passed on to Rayk Bernt and his company RA-BE Immobilien- und Handelsgesellschaft mbH.[479][642][643]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo continued to use the disputed crest on its kits and webpage. But the club would have to ask the owner of the crest every time it wanted to have a pennant made and was unable to exploit the commercial value of the crest for its own benefit.[479][516] The legal situation around the crest would also have caused problems in the event of an advance to the Regionalliga, as the German football Association (DFB) required clubs to own their crests.[517] In order establish independence, the club finally decided to adopt a new crest in 2009.[467]\\n\\nThe new crest abandoned the traditional stylized \\\"D\\\" and the lettering \\\"BFC\\\", as they would have met legal obstacles.[643] The new crest featured a black Berlin bear on claret and white stripes, together with the club name and the founding year.[643] The first version of the new crest sparked controversy. The word \\\"fußball\\\" in the club name had been written in lower case with a double \\\"s\\\" instead of the graphene \\\"ß\\\".[643] This was contrary to German spelling rules, where it is only permissible to write \\\"fußball\\\" with a double \\\"s\\\" when the word is written in upper case. Club President Norbert Uhlig ensured that there was absolutely no ulterior motive behind the spelling and claimed that the word had always been spelled like that on club pennants and scarfs.[643] The Chairman of the Economic Council Peter Meyer later claimed that the spelling was a deliberate marketing ploy, in order to have new crest immediately known across Germany.[643] A second version of the crest was soon made public, where the club name was written in upper case. The new crest was used by BFC Dynamo from the 2009–10 season.[516]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo finally managed win back the traditional crest in 2022, through the Chairman of the Economic Council Peter Meyer. Meyer had acquired the rights to the crest through one of his companies.[644] From the 2023–24 season, BFC Dynamo is once again playing with its traditional crest. The traditional crest was displayed for the first time since its reintroduction in a friendly match against Hertha BSC in front of more than 10,000 spectators at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark on 7 July 2023.[645][646]\\n\\nOwnership of the traditional crest\\nMany clubs in East Germany rushed to drop their East German names during the Peaceful revolution. BFC Dynamo was among the clubs to do so, in an attempt to distance the club from the Stasi.[639][250] The club was rebranded as FC Berlin on 19 February 1990 and consequently abandoned its East German crest.\\n\\nPepe Mager was a famous fan of Hertha BSC and fan merchandise dealer.[641] Mager had organized away trips for the fans Hertha in the early 1960s and was one of the founders of the notorious supporter group \\\"Hertha-Frösche\\\". He now sold his own fan merchandise from a mobile stand outside the Olympiastadion.[641][647][648] Mager inquired with the register of associations in Charlottenburg in 1991 about all deleted names of East German clubs.[641] He immediately found BFC Dynamo and saw business opportunities.[641][639] Mager claimed that he first secured the former crest of BFC Dynamo for 80 D-Marks in 1992.[381][643]\\n\\nThe name FC Berlin never became popular with the fans.[250] Fans continued to identify themselves with the former name and crest.[639] An overwhelming majority voted for the club to take back its original club name at the general meeting on 3 May 1999.[635] Of the 135 present, 125 voted in favor, three against and seven abstained.[309] BFC Dynamo thus reclaimed its East German crest, but the rights to the crest now belonged to Mager.[639] Mager had registered the crest in his name at the German Patent and Trademark Office on 13 May 1997.[639][649][636]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo contacted Mager for a co-operation, but an agreement could not be reached.[641][649] Mager held the opinion that the club should buy its merchandise from him, or simply buy the rights to the crest.[639] He later informed the club that he had received interest from foreign buyers and offered the club to buy the rights.[649] He claimed that the crest was worth 200,000 D-Marks.[639] BFC Dynamo on the other hand claimed that the crest should legally belong to the club. The club sued Mager in court on 20 November 2000, but eventually lost the case.[639][636] The club decided to suspend the legal dispute with Mager in the summer of 2001 and instead wanted to find a solution outside court.[650] Mager was repeatedly exposed to minor threats from the environment around BFC Dynamo and eventually sold the crest to Rayk Bernt and his company RA-BE Immobilien- und Handelsgesellschaft mbH for a price of 50,000 D-Marks in June 2002.[479][642][517][651]\\n\\nBernt was a close associate of André Sommer.[652] Bernt and Sommer had assisted the club at the opening of the insolvency proceedings in 2001–2002.[652][453][479] Both were long time fans of BFC Dynamo.[653][479][642] But the duo was controversial for their connections to Hells Angels.[653][652] Bernt and Sommer were almost as restrictive towards the club when it came to the crest as Mager had been. Bernt organized the production of fan merchandise in his own regime.[642] The club would have to ask his company every time it wanted to have a pennant made.[479] Bernt and Sommer usually agreed, manufactured the pennant and then sold it at their own fan merchandise stand at the stadium.[479] BFC Dynamo continued to use the crest and would at times be given ten percent of the revenues from their sales.[453][479][642][643] The club eventually offered 5,000 Euros for the crest, but was turned down.[453] Sponsor Peter Meyer was also said to have offered 150,000 euros for the buyback.[478] Bernt demanded a seven-digit sum, according to former Club President Mario Weinkauf.[453] The lawyer representing RA-BE Immobilien- und Handelsgesellschaft mbH allegedly claimed the crest was worth around 600,000 Euros at the time.[654]\\n\\nPresident Weinkauf planned to recover the rights to the former crest with the help of Thomas Thiel and the company Treasure AG before the general meeting on 23 June 2007. Thiel was a co-owner of Treasure AG, which was intended as a new major sponsor.[479] Bernt sold parts of the rights to the former crest to Thiel.[655] The price was allegedly a six-digit sum.[479][643] According to the plan, the club would be given the rights of use to the crest. The profits would thus go to the club. The club would pay a symbolic sum of 1 Euro per month for the rights of use. BFC Dynamo would then have a right of first refusal after the ten-year contract had expired and thus have the opportunity to eventually acquire ownership of the crest.[479][656] However, Weinkauf was ultimately rejected by club members in a vote of no-confidence at the general meeting on 23 June 2007.[485] Weinkauf would then be contacted by the former president of Tennis Borussia Berlin Peter Antony. Treasure AG became a sponsor of Tennis Borussia Berlin instead and Weinkauf would later become president of the club.[480]\\n\\nThiel sold his rights to the crest back to Bernt and his company BFC Dynamo Vermarktungsgesellschaft m.b.H in 2009.[657] The rights to the old crest where subsequently controlled again by the company RA-BE Immobilien- und Handelsgesellschaft mbH.[658][659] The company is controlled by Bernt, who sold occasional items with the former crest at his own webpage.[638] However, RA-BE Immobilien- und Handelsgesellschaft mbH transferred its rights to company AXXON AG in 2022.[660][661] In connection with the club\'s 57th anniversary in 2023, the Chairman of the Economic Council Peter Meyer revealed in an exclusive interview with Berliner Kurier that he had acquired the rights to the crest for the club through one of his companies. After more than 13 years, the traditional crest was finally back with the club. According to Berliner Kurier and Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk (MDR), a six-digit sum is said to have become due.[644][662]\\n\\nChampionship star\\nThe German Football League (DFL) introduced a system of championship stars in the 2004–05 season. The system was meant to honor the most successful teams in the Bundesliga by allowing teams to display stars on their shirts for the championships they have won. The system awarded one star for three titles, two stars for five titles, and three stars for ten titles.[663] However, the system only counted titles won in the Bundesliga since the 1963–64 season.[664][665][666]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo submitted an application to the DFL and the DFB on 9 August 2004 to receive three stars for its ten titles in the DDR-Oberliga. The club asked for equal rights and argued that the German Football Association (DFB) had absorbed the German Football Association of the GDR (DFV) with all its statistics, international matches and goal scorers.[663][667][668][664] BFC Dynamo received support from Dynamo Dresden and 1. FC Magdeburg in its attempts to achieve recognition for East German titles.[667][664]\\n\\nThe DFL responded that it was not the responsible body, but the DFB remained silent for a long time.[665] The DFB eventually declared itself responsible and recommended BFC Dynamo to submit a formal application for a new title symbol in accordance with a relevant paragraph.[664][665] BFC Dynamo commissioned a law firm in Mitte in January 2005 and sent a new letter to the DFB. The DFB announced that the application from BFC Dynamo was going to be negotiated in a meeting with the DFB presidium.[665] The meeting with the DFB presidium on 18 March 2005 agreed that all titles won in East Germany, as well all others titles won in Germany since the first recognized championship in 1903, should qualify for stars.[669] However, the decision was subject to approval by the DFL.[670] No final decision had yet been made by the DFB presidium.[671][672][673][674]\\n\\n\\nBFC Dynamo is allowed to wear one star inscribed with the number ten for its ten East German championships.\\nHowever, BFC Dynamo took matters in its own hands and unilaterally emblazoned its shirts with three stars.[672] The team displayed the three stars for first time in the match against FC Energie Cottbus II on 25 March 2005.[672] The claim by BFC Dynamo was controversial because the club had been the favorite club of Erich Mielke and had had a connection to the Stasi during the East German era.[672][673][675][676][666] Critics in the DFB environment pointed to politically influenced championships in East Germany. BFC Dynamo had been sponsored by the Stasi and had enjoyed advantages.[665] The club had privileged access to talents and a permanent training camp at Uckley in Königs Wusterhausen. However, also other clubs in East Germany had enjoyed similar advantages, which put the DFB in a difficult situation.[665] Also former East German referee and CDU parliamentarian Bernd Heynemann spoke out for recognition of all East German titles.[666]\\n\\nThe DFL rejected the application from the DFB and recommended the DFB to only honor clubs that were champions in the Bundesliga.[677] However, the DFB chose to not follow the recommendation. The DFB presidium instead decided on a compromise solution on 19 July 2005 and adopted a new regulation for the 2005–06 season which gave all clubs the right to wear one single star for the championships they have won in the former East Germany and in Germany since 1903. Clubs were also allowed to indicate the number of championships they have won in the center of the star.[678][679][680] The regulation only applies to clubs playing in a league under the DFB umbrella. It does not apply to clubs playing in the 2. Bundesliga and Bundesliga, which are organized by the DFL.[679]\\n\\nThe new regulation meant that BFC Dynamo was finally allowed to emblazon its shirts with a championship star. The regulation also affected other former East German teams including Dynamo Dresden with its eight titles, 1. FC Frankfurt with its six titles and Magdeburg with its three titles in the Oberliga.[665][680] BFC Dynamo has since then used the championship star in accordance with DFB graphic standards, displaying a star inscribed with the number ten for its ten East German titles.[681]\\n\\nStadiums\\nMain article: Stadion im Sportforum\\nThe long-time home and training facility of BFC Dynamo is the Sportforum Hohenschönhausen in Alt-Hohenschönhausen in Berlin. The sports complex is the location of the club offices and the clubhouse.[637] It is also the base of the youth teams.[637] More than 20 youth teams of BFC Dynamo regularly train at the facilities.[682] The Sportforum Hohenschönhausen is considered the spiritual home of the club.[637]\\n\\nThe Sportforum Hohenschönhausen was known as the Dynamo-Sportforum during the East German era.[683] The sports complex was built as a training center for elite sport and was home to sports club SC Dynamo Berlin, with its many departments and squads.[684][685] Development began in 1954 and expansion continued into the 1980s.[686] The Sportforum is still unique as of today.[687] The sports complex covers an area of 45 to 50 hectares and comprises 35 sports facilities as of 2020.[684][687][688][689]\\n\\n\\nA match between SC Dynamo Berlin and SC Turbine Erfurt at the Walter-Ulbricht-Stadion in 1959.\\nSC Dynamo Berlin played its first season at the large Walter-Ulbricht-Stadion in Mitte.[17][690] The team moved its home matches to the football stadium in the Dynamo-Sportforum for the short transitional 1955 season.[691] SC Dynamo Berlin returned to the Walter-Ulbricht-Stadion for the 1956 season.[690] The team would play at the Walter-Ublricht-Stadion for the rest of the 1950s.[690]\\n\\nSC Dynamo Berlin eventually moved its home matches permanentely to the Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum after the construction of the Berlin wall began on 13 August 1961.[17][692] The football stadium in the Dynamo-Sportforum held a capacity of 10,000 spectators at the beginning of the 1961–62 season.[683][nb 8] The team drew average attendances between 3,000 and 6,000 spectators in the DDR-Oberliga at the Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum in the 1960s.[704][705] The highlights were matches against local rival ASK Vorwärts Berlin and the various top teams during the period. The capacity of the football stadium in the Dynamo-Sportforum was gradually expanded during the 1960s.[692][nb 9]\\n\\n\\nA match between BFC Dynamo and BSG Chemie Leipzig at the Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum in 1966.\\nBFC Dynamo began playing occasional matches that required floodlights at the larger Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark in Prenzlauer Berg from November 1968.[692] The Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark was the home ground of FC Vorwärts Berlin at the time. However, the stadium became vacant when FC Vorwärts Berlin was relocated to Frankfurt an der Oder on 31 July 1971.[63] BFC Dynamo played its home matches in the 1971-72 European Cup Winners\' Cup at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark.[708] The matches against Åtvidabergs FF in the quarter-finals on 22 March 1972 and FC Dynamo Moscow in the semi-finals on 5 April 1972 were each attended by 30,000 spectators.[709][710] The team also played two home matches in the 1971-72 DDR-Oberliga at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark.[711] However, more matches at the stadium were not possible after the summer of 1972, as the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark was then undergoing extensive renovation for the upcoming 10th World Festival of Youth and Students.[690]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo was qualified for the 1972-73 UEFA Cup. However, neither the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark nor the Walter-Ulbricht-Stadion were available for the upcoming UEFA Cup matches. Both were undergoing extensive renovation for the 10th World Festival of Youth and Students. Instead, the Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum underwent a complete transformation in just five weeks between the end of July 1972 and September 1972.[690] The capacity of the Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum was now expanded to 20,000 spectators.[712][713][692] BFC Dynamo played all home matches in the 1972-73 UEFA Cup at the Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum. The attendance of 20,000 spectators during the match against Liverpool on 29 November 1972 is still a record attendance for the stadium.[696] BFC Dynamo remained at the Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum for a couple more seasons. The team saw rising attendance numbers at the Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum during the 1970s.[714] An average of 12,000 people attended the last six matches of BFC Dynamo at the Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum in the second half of the 1973–74 season.[692] The match between BFC Dynamo and 1. FC Magdeburg in the 1974-75 DDR-Oberliga at the Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum on 8 March 1975 was attended by a whole 19,000 spectators.[715]\\n\\n\\nA match between BFC Dynamo and SG Dynamo Dresden in front of 25,000 spectators at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark in 1976.[716]\\nBFC Dynamo eventually moved its home matches to the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark for the 1975–76 season, due to upcoming repair work at the Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum.[692] The move was meant to be temporary, but eventually became permanent.[692] The Dynamo-Sportforum would primarily serve as a training facility from then and the football stadium would be used mostly by the reserve team BFC Dynamo II. The Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark held a capacity of 30,00 spectators in the 1975–76 season.[708] The average home attendance of 16,538 spectators for BFC Dynamo at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Stadion in the 1975-76 DDR-Oberliga is the highest average league attendance in club history.[17][717] BFC Dynamo celebrated nine of its ten DDR-Oberliga titles in the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Stadium. The team also played most of its home matches in the UEFA competitions at the stadium. BFC Dynamo hosted teams such as Shakhtar Donetsk, Red Star Belgrade, Nottingham Forest, Hamburger SV, Aston Villa, AS Roma FC Aberdeen at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Stadium in the 1970s and 1980. However, all matches in the derby against 1. FC Union Berlin were played at the neutral Stadion der Weltjugend from the 1976–77 season for security reasons.[294][718][719][720]\\n\\nA permanent training camp for BFC Dynamo was built in Uckley in the Zernsdorf district of Königs Wusterhausen in Bezirk Potsdam at the end of the 1960s.[721] It was located in the woods and completely sealed off from the surroundings.[721][722] The training camp covered an area of around 10 hectares.[722] The complex was equipped with a boarding school, several football pitches, a sports hall, a swimming pool, a fitness area and a sauna.[723][724][725][722][726] The team would gather in Uckley days before its European matches.[17] The players would have access to catering facilities, a nearby lake, a bowling alley, a cinema and pinball machines, among other things.[725][726]\\n\\n\\nThe team of BFC Dynamo in front of the new grandstand of the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark in 1987.\\nBFC Dynamo moved its home matches temporary to the Dynamo-Sportforum for the 1986–87 season, as the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark was undrgoing redevelopment during the season for the upcoming 750th anniversary of Berlin.[692][708] The team also played its home matches in the 1986-87 European Cup at the Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum. The team then returned to the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark for the 1987–88 season.[727] The Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark now had a new four storey grandstand and new floodlight masts. The current grandstand and the floodlights of the stadium dates from this time.[696] The club was rebranded as FC Berlin after Die Wende. FC Berlin moved permanently to the Stadion im Sportforum at the beginning of the 1992–93 season.[696] The team would remain in the Sportforum Hohenschönhausen for many seasons to come.[692]\\n\\nThe capacity of the Stadion im Sportforum had been reduced to about 12,000 spectators by 1992.[692] FC Berlin only drew an average of a couple of hundred spectators per match at the Stadion im Sportforum in the mid-1990s. The highlights were the matches against 1. FC Union Berlin. FC Berlin under Club President Volkmar Wanski announced plans in April 1998 to buy and modernize the stadium.[300] However, the plans eventually failed due to lack of funds. The team saw rising attendance numbers at the Stadion im Sportforum at the end of the 1990s.[714] Active supporters of BFC Dynamo were traditionally found at the northern curved end, popularly known as the Nordwall stand.[717] 4,220 spectators watched the match between BFC Dynamo and Union Berlin at the Stadion im Sportforum on 23 November 1999.[728]\\n\\nSupporters of BFC Dynamo installed new bucket seats on the main stand and built a new clubhouse next to the main stand of the Stadion im Sportforum in 2002–2003.[729] The Stadion im Sportforum was then equipped with a 25-metre player tunnel and plexiglass-clad coaching benches in November 2004.[730] BFC Dynamo made new plans for a modern football stadium in the Sportforum Hohenschönhausen in 2006 under Club President Mario Weinkauf. The club now wanted to build a new modern stadium for 10,000–15,000 spectators.[731] However, these plans did not materialize either. The Stadion im Sportforum was closed at the end of the 2005–06 season following the riots during the match between BFC Dynamo and Union Berlin on 13 May 2006.[457] BFC Dynamo temporarily had to move to the Friedrich-Ludwg-Jahn-Sportpark.[461] The stadium was then refurbished in 2006–2007 to increase safety and meet the requirements of the NOFV.[487] The refurbishment included a new fence.[732]\\n\\n\\nA match between BFC Dynamo and SV Babelsberg 03 on 23 April 2017.\\nBFC Dynamo won promotion to the Regionalliga Nordost at the end of the 2013–14 season. The team moved permanently to the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark for the 2014–15 season, due to increased media and spectator interest following its promotion.[696][733] The 2014-15 Regionalliga Nordost meant matches against well-known opponents such as 1. FC Magdeburg and FC Carl Zeiss Jena. The more central location of the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark was seen by the club as an opportunity to attract more spectators.[733] The match between BFC Dynamo and 1. FC Magdeburg on 8 November 2014 was attended by 5,103 spectators.[734] Active supporters of BFC Dynamo have traditionally been found on the main stand, and on the side opposite the main stand (German: die Gegengerade) of the Friedrich Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark.[717] The match between BFC Dynamo and FC Schalke 04 in the first round of the 2018-19 DFB-Pokal at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark on 17 August 2017 was watched by 14,117 spectators.[570] The attendance was the highest attendance for BFC Dynamo since the fall of the Berlin wall.[570][86] The average league attendance of BFC Dynamo in the 2017-18 Regionalliga Nordost would also be the highest average league attendance of BFC Dynamo since the 1990-91 season.[705]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo had to play a number of matches at the Stadion im Sportforum at the end of the 2018–19 season due to safety issues relating to the dilapidated floodlights at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark.[735] The move was greeted by some supporters as a move to the true home of the club.[736] The club was then set to return to the Sportforum in the 2020–21 season as the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark was planned to be demolished for a complete redevelopment.[637] The team was allowed to continue play in the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark until 31 December 2020.[737] BFC Dynamo then officially announced on 21 March 2021 that the club was going to move back to the Sportforum Hohenschönhausen for the next season.[738]\\n\\nThe Stadion im Sportforum was equipped with a floodlight system in April 2021.[739][740] The club organized a work effort in the summer of 2021 to get the stadium in shape for the upcoming Regionalliga season. [741] Supporters of BFC Dynamo gathered and cleared sections of the old stadium from weeds.[742] Members of the interest group IG BFC\'er also restored the iconic manual scoreboard above the curved end towards the Weißenseer Weg in time for the first home match of the 2021–22 season against Energie Cottbus on 28 July 2021.[743] The attendance for BFC Dynamo at the Stadion im Sportforum in the 2021-22 Regionalliga Nordost was almost tripled compared to the last comparable league season before the COVID-19 pandemic. 3,219 people watched the match between BFC Dynamo and FC Carl Zeiss Jena on 10 April 2022.[744]\\n\\nFuture stadium\\nThe large stadium in the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark is planned to be demolished towards the end of 2023 for a complete redevelopment.[745] The new stadium im the Fredrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark is designed as an inclusive sports facility. The stadium will hold 20,000 spectators and meet the requirements for play in the 3. Liga and 2. Bundesliga.[746][747][745] BFC Dynamo will be able to play matches at the new stadium. The new stadium in the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark is planned to be opened in 2028.[748]\\n\\nSupporters\\nEast German era\\nBFC Dynamo played only a minor role in football in Berlin until the relocation of FC Vorwärts Berlin to Frankfurt an der Oder in 1971.[717] The club initially had modest support, but with its growing successes in the 1970s, the club began to attract young fans, primarily from the central areas around the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark, such as Prenzlauer Berg and Mitte.[174] Many came from working class families in Prenzlauer Berg.[749] One of the first big supporter groups of BFC Dynamo was Black Eagle. The fan club was founded in 1972 and was one of the earliest fan clubs in East German football. Fans of BFC Dynamo were the first to sew their embroidered fan club badges on their jackets. This was a novelty among football supporters in East Germany in the 1970s.[750]\\n\\nThe supporter scene became a focal point for various subcultures in the late 1970s and beginning of the 1980s.[751][520][752] There were punks, rockers, hippies and a few early skinheads.[751][717][753][754][137] Some were left-leaning and others were right-leaning.[751][754] Football and stadium life offered free spaces that were difficult for the authorities to control.[137] For some fans, being part of the supporter scene was an opportunity to rebel against the East German regime.[751] Most supporters of BFC Dynamo had little to do with the state. It was more important for them to protest, do their own thing and break out from everyday life.[717] Despite cheering for a club associated with the Stasi, supporters of BFC Dynamo were not loyal to the line.[751] Many active fans of BFC Dynamo in the 1980s were against the regime.[177][754] Some supporters would even cut out the \\\"D\\\" for SV Dynamo from their club patches. They considered the \\\"BFC\\\" to be free from the Stasi, while they thought the \\\"D\\\" symbolized the exact opposite.[755]\\n\\n\\\"We provoked with chants and slogans. We were right, left, punk, hippie, skinhead. We were direct and provocative, kind and evil, in love, or drunk. Cool words were always well received. Right or left, I don\'t want to classify one. We were all in our fan group against the GDR, rebellion!\\\"\\n\\n– A fan of BFC Dynamo in the 1980s[756]\\nYoung people were gradually attracted by the provocative image of the club: its successes, its reputation as a Stasi club and the hatred of opposing fans.[520][752] Some fans of BFC Dynamo found delight in the unpopularity of their club and took pride in the hatred they met.[754][757][32] One fan recalled that the 1980s \\\"were my greatest years, as we always had glorious success in provoking other fans\\\" and another one that \\\"we were really hated by everyone\\\".[757] Fans of BFC Dynamo would sometimes respond to the hatred they met by singing chants in praise of Erich Mielke as a provocation.[758] They would also throw tropical fruits, that were only available in East Berlin, at home fans during away matches in Saxony.[178][753]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo came to be associated with areas such as Prenzlauer Berg, Pankow, Weißensee, Hohenschönhausen and certain cafés and restaurants in vicinity of Alexanderplatz.[759][760] The supporter scene included groups such as Black Eagle, Norbert Trieloff, Bobbys, Iron Fist, Beatles BFC Club, Die Ratten, Berliner Wölfe, Heavy Horses, Black Pahnter and Madness boys of Preussen in the 1980s.[761] Fashion played a big role in the BFC Dynamo supporter scene.[32][754] Football supporters in East Berlin shared a sense of superiority over their counterparts in the regional districts.[760][751] This was also the case with the supporters of Union Berlin, but notably with the supporters of BFC Dynamo.[760][762][177][763]\\n\\nFootball-related violence spread in East Germany in the 1970s.[137][764] The supporter scene of BFC Dynamo was still young at the time, while clubs such Union Berlin and BSG Chemie Leipzig had large followings.[32] A trip to Leipzig or Dresden was a difficult task.[717] Supporters of BFC Dynamo responded to the hostile environment, and learned to compensate their smaller numbers, by being more aggressive and better organized.[765][174][32][766] The dislike against BFC Dynamo in stadiums around the country and the hatred of opposing fans welded its supporters together.[767] One fan of BFC Dynamo said: \\\"This feeling of being hated is what makes it so appealing.\\\" A saying among the supporters of BFC Dynamo was: \\\"We are few, but we are awesome!\\\" (German: Wir sind wenig, wir sind geil!)[768][32] One fan of BFC Dynamo recalled: \\\"It was really rumbling at away trips, and only then you felt your own strength. When we went with 200 people against 1,000 Unioners and you noticed: If you stick together, you have an incredible amount of violence.\\\"[769] Supporters of BFC Dynamo would eventually gain a reputation for being particularly violent and organized.[174] One fan of Union Berlin recalled: \\\"There was hardly an enemy mob against us, we were just too many... But the people who stood in the way of the violence-seeking BFC:ers were very few... The BFC:ers were completely organized. These hundred and fifty people, everyone knew each other. They stood as a block like a wall.\\\"[770] The book \\\"Riot Boys!\\\" by Jochen Schramm depicts the supporter scene of BFC Dynamo and contains stories of violent away trips in the early 1980s. Jochen \\\"Ellis\\\" Schramm was a member of the hooligan scene of BFC Dynamo in the 1980s.[771]\\n\\nThe development in the supporter scene of BFC Dynamo would eventually catch the attention of the authorities. The Stasi conducted a study on the violent structures of the supporter scene at the beginning of the 1980s. It found that 80 percent of those committing violent acts were 16–25 years old. Most of them were workers or students.[760] It also found that 20 percent came from families of the socialist intelligentia.[177][760] The Stasi assigned a group of two full-time officers from the district administration to the supporter scene during 1982–83 season.[772] From then, supporters of BFC Dynamo were accompanied, observed and documented.[773] This was a measure that had previously also been applied to the supporter scene of Union Berlin.[178] The authorities had allegedly been particularly alarmed when supporters of BFC Dynamo unfurled a poster in memory of Lutz Eigendorf with the text \\\"Iron Foot, we mourn you!\\\" during a match at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark in April 1983.[774][773][174] Supporters had also started a fan club in honour of Eigendorf.[753] The Stasi would try to control the supporter scene with a broad catalogue of measures: persistent talks, intimidation attempts, reporting requirements and arrests.[717][751] It would also attempt to infiltrate the fan clubs by unofficial collaborators (IM).[772] All football fan clubs in East Germany had to undergo registration.[137] According to Stasi information, BFC Dynamo had six registered fan clubs and 22 unauthorized fan clubs in 1986. Unauthorized fan clubs were those that were unregistered or did not meet DFV guidelines.[775] East German state television always tryied to hide riots from viewers. But the sound recording from football matches was the biggest problem. Additional sound systems were integrated into the stadium of BFC Dynamo for radio and television broadcasts. The system was also supposed to drown out shouts and chanting from the violent structures, so that television viewers and radio listeners would not hear anything.[776]\\n\\nThe supporter scene of BFC Dynamo came to be increasingly associated with skinheads and far-right tendencies from the mid-1980s.[174] More and more supporters of BFC Dynamo began to embrace skinhead fashion in the early 1980s.[751][717] Skinhead fashion was now considered the most provocative outfit.[751] By the mid-1980s, the club had become one of the most popular football clubs in the growing skinhead movement.[32][nb 10] The reputation of BFC Dynamo as the hated Stasi club also attracted skinheads, who used the club as a stage for their provocations.[520] Right-wing slogans and fascist chants were considered as the most challenging provocations, as anti-fascism was state doctrine and Nazism officially did not exist in East Germany.[783][137][174][751][784][637] For young people, being a Nazi was sometimes considered the sharpest form of opposition.[785] However, instances of Nazi provocations did not necessarily reflect genuine political convictions. At least some part of the \\\"drift to the right\\\" among East German youth during the 1980s was rooted in a desire to position oneself wherever the state was not.[786] One fan of BFC Dynamo said: \\\"None of us really knew anything about politics. But to raise your arm in front of the Volkspolizei was a real kick. You did that and for some of them, their whole world just fell apart\\\".[787][717][174][nb 11]\\n\\nThe first East German hooligan group developed from the supporter scene of BFC Dynamo in the 1980s. The development was partly a response to the increasing state repression against the supporter scene, notably from the Stasi.[190] An organized hooligan scene with groups, structures and training rooms, that was unique in East Germany, would eventually emerge at BFC Dynamo.[766] The hooligans of BFC Dynamo initially reacted with restraint to police intervention in the fan block. There was a risk of going to jail. However, the Volkspolizei were sometimes ruthless, especially at away matches. Towards the end of the 1980s, there was an uprising and the hooligans of BFC Dynamo now began to confront the police with violence.[794] The final of the 1987-88 FDGB-Pokal between BFC Dynamo and Carl Zeiss Jena on 4 June 1988 saw some of the most serious violence ever witnessed at an East German football match.[4] A group of 100 to 150 skinheads and other hooligans marched through Pankow to the Stadion der Weltjugend for the match. They chanted fascist slogans and clashed with other supporters.[795][779] Riots then broke out in one of the blocks shortly before the end of the match. Supporters destroyed fences and threw seats at match stewards.[796] A group of 300 supporters of BFC Dynamo attempted to invade the pitch during the victory ceremony. They caused extensive damage to 60 seating benches.[786] About a year later, supporters of BFC Dynamo would also destroy large parts of a block of the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark, during the match against AS Monaco in the 1989–90 European Cup Winners\' Cup on 1 November 1989.[797][798][nb 12]\\n\\nGerman reunification\\nA wave of violence swept through the football stadiums of East Germany in 1990.[178] The collapse of the East German regime resulted in a security vacuum.[800][801][802] The Volkspolizei was overwhelmed by the amount of disorder and often reluctant to use enough force, due to the political situation.[803][178][804][264]\\n\\n\\nSupporters of FC Berlin during the away match against FC Carl Zeiss Jena on 8 April 1990.\\nMasked supporters of FC Berlin rioted in central Jena before the away match against FC Carl Zeiss Jena in the 1989-90 DDR-Oberliga on 8 April 1990. They broke shop windows, smashed windscreens of police vehicles with stones and left a trail of destruction in the city center. Supporters of FC Berlin also fired flares at police officers during the match.[805] The disorder at the stadium would not cease and the match was eventually interrupted.[32] The riots in Jena caught rare attention by East German state media, which until then had been generally silent about football related disorder.[32][751]\\n\\n\\nA flare thrown on the pitch during the match between FC Carl Zeiss Jena and FC Berlin on 8 April 1990.\\nThere were now riots now after every home match in FC Berlin. After the last home match in the 1989-90 NOFV-Oberliga against BSG Wismut Aue on 26 May 1990, a group of 300 supporters of FC Berlin marched from Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark towards Alexanderplatz. Windows were smashed, cars were damaged and a minibus was overturned as they made their way. Supporters met at the Marx-Engels-Forum. A group of 200 people then formed a human swastika in front of the Volkspolizei. There were 21 arrests, and the police seized knives, knuckle dusters and pepper spray.[806]\\n\\nHooligans who had left East Germany for various reasons in recent years rejoined the hooligan scene after the opening of the Berlin Wall.[265][807] Some were former skinheads who had been deported by the Stasi to West Germany in the late 1980s. Now they chanted things such as \\\"Who should be our Führer? Erich Mielke!\\\" as a provocative fun, to the dismay of the club.[265][804] Supporters who returned from West Germany also brought back a new fashion based on designer clothing labels and expensive sportswear, which was adopted by the supporter scene.[265][767] While combat boots and bomber jackets were now common at many places in East Germany, some supporters of BFC Dynamo wanted to differentiate themselves. Expensive sneakers was now the new fashion in the supporter scene.[717][807][808] Brands such as Diesel, Iceberg, Chevignon, Adidas, Best Company, New Balance and Ray Ban became popular.[767][265][808][760]\\n\\nThe reputation of the hooligans of FC Berlin attracted a large number of new young people who joined the hooligan scene.[265] A series of violence occurred in connection with the cup match between Union Berlin and FC Berlin in the Second round of the 1990-91 FDGB-Pokal on 23 September 1990. Hooligans of FC Berlin stormed the home stands of the Stadion an der Alten Försterei armed with clubs and flares and hunted down supporters of Union Berlin.[263][809] Riots broke out after match. Aound 250 hooligans threw gravel and other objects at the police. At least 14 police officers were injured in the clashes.[810] Serious riots then continued in the city, involving hundreds of supporters. Street battles broke out in areas of East Berlin, even spreading to Kreuzberg in West Berlin.[811] One supporter of FC Berlin said: \\\"In 1990, thanks to the many departures to the West, it became clear relatively quickly that there was no flowerpot to be won with the current team. We then turned our attention to other things.\\\"[812]\\n\\nHooligans in East Germany unleashed almost unbridled violence against the representatives of the disintegrating East German state.[802] Violent riots had occurred in Rostock, Dresden, Erfurt and East Berlin.[802] Police had been forced to shoot warning shots during violent riots in Leipzig and one match in the 1990-91 NOFV-Oberliga had already been abandoned due to riots in the stadium.[803][813][814][815][nb 13] The situation peaked during a match between FC Sachsen Leipzig and FC Berlin on 3 November 1990. Supporters of FC Berlin travelled in large numbers to Leipzig for the match.[802] The police had only 219 officers available for the match.[264] There were clashes at the Leipzig main railway station, with one police officer injured and 50 supporters taken into custody.[264][816] A first group of around 100 supporters of FC Berlin entered the Georg-Schwarz-Sportpark in time for kick-off.[802] They were joined by a hooligans of 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig, who had forced their way into the stadium.[817][818][819][777] Supporters of both camps tried to attack each other in the stadium and the police had difficulties in maintaining a buffer zone.[264] A second group of up to 400 supporters of FC Berlin arrived later at the nearby Leipzig-Leutzsch S-Bahn station at Am Ritterschlößchen street.[802][264] Fireworks were fired as they made their way to the stadium.[820] The group was blocked from entering the stadium by police equipped with helmets and shields, despite showing valid tickets.[821][822][265] The supporters were not given any reason.[820] They were then pushed back by the police using tear gas and truncheons.[802][264][821] The group returned to the S-Bahn station and made an attempt to reach the stadium from the Pettenkofer Straße instead.[802] They were again blocked by police who immediately used truncheons.[802][820]\\n\\nRiots broke out at the S-Bahn station.[802] The station building was vandalized and numerous cars were smashed or burned, including at least one W 50 police truck and one police car.[802][264][820][816] The police was allegedly outnumbered.[823][nb 14] Cobblestones were thrown at the police waiting at the Pettenkofer Straße.[802] The police now decided to use their firearms.[802] 18-year old supporter Mike Polley (de) from the locality of Malchow in Berlin was hit by several bullets and instantly killed.[265][807] He was allegedly about to bend down to a friend when hit.[826] Several others were injured and at least another three people were seriously injured.[801][264][821] One supporter of FC Berlin was hit in the head and suffered critical injuries, but survived.[265] The police had fired between 50 and 100 shots in about a minute, from 11 different police pistols.[264][821] Reports and sources vary on what happened on the scene and how the situation was.[264] The police claim that they were surrounded.[823] But this was rebuffed by an eyewitness.[820] Shots had been fired from distances as long as 30–40 meters.[264][820] The police had also fired at fleeing supporters.[820] One supporter was hit while trying to escape into an S-Bahn train.[820] Not every injured had come with the supporters of FC Berlin. Also an uninvolved woman was shot in the leg.[264]\\n\\nAfter the shootings, some supporters of FC Berlin left the S-Bahn station by train.[823] Many were shaken, but other wanted to take revenge.[820] A group of supporters stopped a tram, kicked the driver out and maneuvered it down town.[265][802] Riots now continued in central Leipzig, where policed presence was low.[820] The riots in central Leipzig continued for several hours and the damage was extensive.[265][802][777] Supporters of FC Berlin devastated entire streets.[823] All shop windows on the Nikolaistraße opposite the main railway station were broken.[816] There was rampage at the Park Hotel.[818][824] The ground floor of a department store on Brühl was destroyed.[824] Numerous cars were demolished and up to 31 shops were smashed and looted.[824][823][264] Supporters clashed with transport police at the main railway station. New shots were fired by the police, but no one was injured.[823][265][264]\\n\\n\\nSupporters of FC Berlin commemorate Mike Polley at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark, during the match against HFC Chemie in the 1990-91 NOFV-Oberliga on 10 November 1990.\\nMike Polley was considered a beginner in the supporter scene.[823] A demonstration against police violence with 1,000 participants was arranged in Prenzlauer Berg by supporters of FC Berlin after the match against HFC Chemie on 10 November 1990.[32][264][777] The demonstration was supported by the recently founded Fanprojekt Berlin.[264] Also professional FC Berlin players such as Waldemar Ksienzyk participated in the march.[257] The demonstration received support from politicians such as Lena Schraut from the Alternative List and from left-wing activists, notably from the occupied houses near Senefelderplatz at the Schönhauser Allee.[777][265] The friendly match between East Germany and West Germany that was planned to be held on the Zentralstadion in Leipzig on 21 November 1990 was cancelled for security reasons and due to the tense situation among football supporters after the shootings.[264][777] An investigation against ten police officers was opened, but closed in April 1992.[264][777] The exact circumstances around the death of Mike Polley were never fully clarified.[822][827]\\n\\nStadium attendance collapsed in 1990. Many supporters of BFC Dynamo stopped attending matches after the Peaceful revolution, as the best players were sold off to clubs in West Germany, sports performance slumped, tickets prices rose, mass unemployment spread and hooligans had come to dominate the stands.[178][801][637][828] Some shifted their focus to ice hockey instead.[829] The average league attendance of the 1990–91 NOFV-Oberliga was by far the lowest in the league history.[801] BFC Dynamo was hit particularly hard by the decline. Average league attendance at BFC Dynamo had dropped from 8,385 in the 1988–89 season to 1,076 in the 1990–91 season.[830][831][832] Ordinary supporters had disappeared. Only young supporters remained in the stadium at FC Berlin in 1990 and 1991.[178]\\n\\nThe violent faction of FC Berlin would come to shape the entire 1990–91 season.[265] Matches involving FC Berlin were all security matches.[264] A group of 500–600 supporters of FC Berlin travelled with a special train to Rostock for an away match against F.C. Hansa Rostock on 16 March 1991.[265][833] The police did not manage to control the situation despite a record strong presence of more than 600 officers.[833][834] Riots broke out in central Rostock, where supporters smashed shops, demolished cars and attacked people.[265][767][833] Supporters without tickets stormed the Ostseestadion and there were fights with supporters of F.C. Hansa Rostock around the stadium.[833] Riots at the train station after the match had to be suppressed by the police with tear gas and water cannons.[833][265] The damage was again extensive. Up to 17 shops at the Wismarischen Straße were smashed and looted, the train station was devastated and the special train was vandalized.[834] 21 people were injured in the clashes, including nine police officers.[835][836] The damages amounted to around 750,000 Deutsche Marks.[836] The Minister President of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern Alfred Gomolka believed the Stasi was behind the riots. He claimed that the hooligans of FC Berlin were controlled by \\\"Stasi remnants\\\" who wanted to cause \\\"destabilization\\\". Also the Interior Minister of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern Georg Diederich saw the riots as a political confrontation. As a proof, they pointed to the fact that supporters of FC Berlin came with East German flags and that the club had pre-financed the special train to Rostock.[835]\\n\\nThe youth television programme Elf99 on Deutscher Fernsehfunk (DFF) ran a special story on the hooligans of FC Berlin in August 1991. The story was called \\\"Elf-Spezial: Das randalierende Rätsel – Der Berliner Hooligans zwischen Wahn und Scham?\\\" and can be found on YouTube as of 2020.[837] About 200 supporters of FC Berlin traveled to the top match against Greifswalder SC 1926 in the 1991-92 NOFV-Oberliga Nord on 3 November 1991. Repeated riots broke out during the match. Supporters of FC Berlin claim they were insulted as \\\"Stasi-pigs!\\\" by spectators in Greifswald. Supporters of FC Berlin fought with other spectators and the stadium facilities were demolished in the riots.[838] Up to 100 hooligans of FC Berlin also attacked an asylum shelter that was located right next to the stadium in Greifswald.[839][840][788][841] SV Hafen Rostock 61 subsequently postponed its upcoming league match at home against FC Berlin for security reasons.[842][841]\\n\\nHooliganism\\nThe hooligan scene of FC Berlin at the beginning of the 1990s was considered the most notorious for years in Germany. Hooligans of FC Berlin were subsequently involved in numerous fights in stadiums, woods and meadows.[178] Organized fights with other hooligan groups began in 1992 and 1993.[265] However, hooligans of FC Berlin were also involved in fights with squatters and other left-wing groups in the 1990s.[265] 25 supporters of FC Berlin fought 40 people from the left-wing scene in front of a pub on the Straße der Pariser Kommune in Friedrichshain on 17 April 1995. Several people were injured.[843] A number of people allegedly associated with the hooligan scene of FC Berlin attacked formerly occupied houses and a meeting point for left-wing football supporters at Brunnenstraße 6 and 7 in Mitte on the night of 6 September 1997. A punk concert was held on the premises at the time. Four people had to be hospitalized with injuries.[844]\\n\\nIn the years after German reunification, the club\'s eternal outside image attracted people from the underground.[752] Playing for meager crowds in regional leagues, the club eventually became a meeting place for individuals from Berlin\'s far-right, hooligan and criminal underground.[637][845] By the mid-1990s, the hooligan scene of FC Berlin had developed a connection to the eastern Berlin bouncer scene.[387] The eastern Berlin bouncer scene would eventually be almost completely organized from the hooligan scene of BFC Dynamo.[799][846] One of those involved in the assault on French policeman Daniel Nivel during the 1998 FIFA World Cup had connections to the hooligan scene of FC Berlin.[637] The same man was later linked to organized crime and eventfully involved in a high-profile drug trafficking case.[847][848][637]\\n\\nThe match between BFC Dynamo and Berlin Türkspor 1965 in the final of the 1998–99 Berlin Cup on 11 May 1999 was marked by violence. Supporters of BFC Dynamo directed far-right chants and others provocations against Berlin Türkspor 1965 during the match.[849] 400 supporters of BFC Dynamo invaded the pitch after the final whistle to celebrate the title. Some supporters also attacked players of Berlin Türkspor 1965. Two players of Berlin Türkspor 1965 were injured, one of them had suffered a stab wound.[850] BFC Dynamo Club President Volkmar Wanski was able to prevent a total escalation by giving a calming speech over the stadium microphone.[851] He immediately apologized for the behavior of the supporters at the press conference after the match.[850] Older supporters of BFC Dynamo openly expressed their contempt for the far-right supporters that had visited the match.[852] BFC Dynamo and Berlin Türkspor 1965 agreed to meet in a friendly match later in the season and to organize a joint meal for players and responsible.[853] Wanski made it clear in the speakers ahead of the last home match against FC Rot-Weiß Erfurt in the 1998-99 Regionalliga Nordost on 15 May 1999 that \\\"anyone who cannot behave has no business in our stadium\\\".[854]\\n\\nSerious riots broke out in Prenzlauer Berg after the match between BFC Dynamo and 1. FC Union Berlin in the Round of 16 of the 2000–01 Berlin Cup at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark on 24 March 2001. Around 150 supporters of BFC Dynamo attacked the police after the match, as they wanted to storm the block of Union Berlin.[855][342] Around 500 supporters of BFC Dynamo then attacked police at Eberswalder Straße.[342] The police employed water cannons against supporters at Eberswalder Straße and Schönhauser Allee. Nine people, including four police officers, were injured.[855][342] BFC Dynamo Club President Karin Halsch (de) and 1. FC Union Berlin Club President Heiner Bertram criticized the police in unison for provocations during the match and for triggering riots.[341] Karin Halsch simultaneously expressed sadness that the riots destroyed a lot of reconstruction work in the club and announced that there would be many stadium bans.[341][856] Also coach Jürgen Bogs spoke out about \\\"senseless violence\\\" that would once again fall back on the club, but also criticized the police for provocations.[341] Many of those involved in the riots did not come from the supporter scene of BFC Dynamo. Many were visitors from other cities in Germany.[387]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo had the highest number of violent supporters in Germany in 2005.[857] Violence broke out during the match between Tennis Borussia Berlin and BFC Dynamo in the 2004-05 NOFV-Oberliga Nord at the Mommsenstadion on 11 February 2005. A flare was lit and a couple of bangers set off in the guest block at the beginning of the second half. Police then decided to intervene against away supporters. Police officers were pelted with beer cups and attacked by supporters of BFC Dynamo when they entered gest block. Eight police officers were injured and 11 supporters of BFC Dynamo arrested. BFC Dynamo criticized the police operation as \\\"disproportionate\\\".[858][431] Supporters of BFC Dynamo claimed that they had been called \\\"Nazis\\\", \\\"Ossis\\\" and \\\"Unioners\\\" by police officers. Riots had broken out also when Tennis Borussia Berlin played 1. FC Union Berlin in round of 16 of the 2004-05 Berlin Cup at the Mommsenstadion a couple of weeks before.[431]\\n\\nFighting between supporters of BFC Dynamo and police again broke out in connection with the match between BFC Dynamo and SV Yeşilyurt at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark on 24 April 2005. The mood had been tense during the match. The situation escalated when celebrating supporters of BFC Dynamo attacked the fence after the final whistle. Police intervened with water hoses, batons and tear gas against supporters of BFC Dynamo. Four police officers were injured and five hooligans arrested. One police officer suffered a broken nose and another one a concussion.[859][860] Riots again broke out in connection to a match between BFC Dynamo and SV Yeşilyurt at the opening of the 2005-06 NOFV-Oberliga Nord at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark 5 August 2005. The match was attended by 1,200 supporters of BFC Dynamo. Hooligans in the crowd threw bottles and stones at police officers during the match. Fights between hooligans and police then broke out after match. Around 150 hooligans had participated in the riots, according to police information.[861][438] BFC Dynamo spokesperson Yiannis Kaufmann claimed that those involved were a \\\"mob of travelling fans who wants to cause trouble everywhere and now discredit the BFC\\\".[861] As many as 13 police officers were injured in the riots.[439][440]\\n\\n\\nThe Stadion im Sportforum on 14 May 2006.\\nPolice made a controversial raid against the discotheque Jeton in Friedrichshain where supporters of BFC Dynamo and other people had gathered to celebrate in connection to a fan tournament in memory of Mike Polley on the night of 20 August 2005. The fan tournament had been visited by numerous teams, including teams from FC St. Pauli, 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig, Aberdeen F.C., VfL Bochum and Malmö FF.[862][863][864] The large-scale police operation involved 300 officers, including 100 members of the SEK.[865][866][867] 158 persons were arrested. Among the detainees were 19 Category C-supporters and 22 Category B-supporters.[439][866] Supporters filed numerous complaints against the police for use of excessive violence.[868] 39 people at the discotheque were injured.[440] Also bystanders were affected.[440] Police initially claimed they had been pelted with bottles and furnishings, but later corrected their statement and admitted that there had been no resistance.[865][440][439] The police had allegedly beaten defenseless people.[869] Police stated that the raid was a preventative measure on short notice to prevent hooligans from organizing for the upcoming match against Union Berlin on 21 August 2005.[440][866] There were speculations that police also took revenge for riots during the match between BFC Dynamo and SV Yeşilyurt at the opening of the season.[440][439] More than 1,000 police officers were deployed to the derby and the match was played without crowd trouble.[866][867] Banners in solidarity with the supporters of BFC Dynamo were displayed in 17 football stadiums across Germany during the following matchdays.[870]\\n\\nThe return match between BFC Dynamo and Union Berlin in the 2005–06 NOFV-Oberliga Nord was played at the Stadion im Sportforum on 13 May 2006. The standing was 1–1 when supporters of BFC Dynamo invaded the pitch in an attempt to storm the block of Union Berlin around the 75th minute.[871] Supporters of Union Berlin fled in panic.[872] The match was abandoned and Union Berlin was awarded a 2–0 win.[871][873] The players of BFC Dynamo wore the motto \\\"No power of violence\\\" on their shirts in the following match against BFC Preussen away on 17 May 2006.[874] The Stadion im Sportforum was temporarily closed for matches in the NOFV-Oberliga Nord after the riots.[457] The riots during the match against 1. FC Union Berlin threw the club into a financial crisis. Treasurer Sven Radicke concluded: \\\"Four years of our work were ruined in five minutes\\\".[459]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo has often attracted hooligans from outside, and hooligans who are otherwise not involved in the supporter scene, to high-profile matches.[520][875][530] The club has repeatedly complained about so-called \\\"riot tourists\\\".[530][876] Riots broke out after the match against Berliner AK 07 in the final of the 2009–10 Berlin Cup at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark on 2 June 2010. Around 100–150 supporters of BFC Dynamo attempted to invade the pitch after the final whistle.[519][875] Match stewards and players of BFC Dynamo threw themselves in to restrain supporters and prevent further riots.[519][877][875][520] One of them was goalkeeper Nico Thomaschewski, who later received an award from the Berlin Football Association (BFV) for his actions.[875] Polish fans of Pogoń Szczecin were allegedly linked to the riots.[875] Those who had invaded the pitch were whistled by other supporters of BFC Dynamo when they returned to the stands.[878]\\n\\nMajor riots then occurred after the match against 1. FC Kaiserslautern in the first round of the 2011-12 DFB-Pokal at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark on 3 July 2011.[528][529] Around 200–300 supporters of BFC Dynamo invaded the buffer zone and stormed the guest block after the match.[530][520] 18 police officers and many supporters from Kaiserslautern were injured in the attack.[520] The Chairman of the Economic Council Peter Meyer openly expressed his embarrassment and disappointment over the behavior of some supporters and publicly apologized.[530] There were allegations that hooligans outside the BFC Dynamo environment had been involved.[530] While the police stated that most of those arrested were from Berlin, the club claimed it had never seen most of the recent perpetrators before.[520]\\n\\nThe contemporary supporter scene\\nThe contemporary supporter scene contains various subcultures and categories of supporters. It ranges from older supporters to younger ultras.[749] Older supporters constitute an essential part of the supporter scene.[752] Many are active in the supporter group 79er.[875] The group is credited for its commitment to the club, notably the youth teams. Its members have been supporters of BFC Dynamo since the late 1970s.[875][717]\\n\\nThe supporter scene played an important part in saving the club from bankruptcy in 2001.[637] Supporters organized a demonstration against the impending bankruptcy. The demonstration marched from the Sportforum to the Rotes Rathaus where it was met by the former club president and SPD politician Karin Halsch.[368][369] Supporters threw parties and organized collections, made donations and travelled to countries such as Austria and Switzerland to convince creditors to accept smaller pay-offs in order to save the cub.[637] Supporters also installed bucket seats at the Stadion im Sportforum and built a new clubhouse in the Sportforum during the insolvency.[729][879] The insolvency crisis remains a defining moment for older supporters.[637] The supporter scene has traditionally arranged an annual Mike-Polley-Gedenkturnier, which is a football fan tournament in memory of Mike Polley.[822][880] The first edition of the fan tournament was arranged in the Sportforum Hohenschönhausen in 2003 and comprised 28 teams.[881] A march in memory of Mike Polley in Leipzig in 2018 was attended by 850 supporters of BFC Dynamo.[882]\\n\\nNew groups of younger ultra-oriented supporters have emerged since the 2000s.[875][717] Supporter group Fraktion H was founded in 2006 by younger supporters who wanted to create more atmosphere in the stadium.[875][717] A minor ultras scene then emerged with the founding of supporter group Ultras BFC in 2011. The ultras of BFC Dynamo have initiated campaigns such as \\\"Brown is not Claret\\\" and have also engaged in football tournaments for refugees.[845][717][883][608] The club has encouraged the new groups of younger supporters and club management has taken a stand against racism and right-wing extremism.[884][883][608] Fraktion H maintains a friendship with the supporters of Eintracht Trier, while members of the now dissolved Ultras BFC have had contacts with the ultras of Swedish football club GAIS.[885]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo is affiliated with Fanprojekt Berlin, which is an independent organization that engages in socio-pedagogical fan work.[752][886] The organization supports young fans in various aspects of life and aims at promoting a positive supporter culture.[886] BFC Dynamo engages in active fan work and has taken measures to control violent elements, to exclude known violators and to distance itself from radical supporters.[752][530][883] Far-right symbols and slogans are not tolerated by the club.[752] The Chairman of the Economic Council, Peter Meyer, stated publicly in connection with a friendly match against Hertha BSC in 2007 that the club did not want people who cannot follow the rules and that \\\"anyone who shouts Nazi slogans will be thrown out of the stadium\\\".[495] Lawyer and former Vice President of BFC Dynamo René Lau said in an interview with Deutsche Welle in 2019: \\\"If you had asked me 25 years ago [if BFC had a problem with Nazis], I would have said yes. But is today\'s BFC Dynamo a Nazi club? I would vehemently dispute that.\\\"[637] A large number of stadium bans has been issued by the club since the mid-2000s.[887][530] A total of 40 stadium bans was issued only in 2006.[888][887] No riots has occurred since 2011.[752]\\n\\nThe contemporary supporter scene has includes groups such as 79er, Mythos BFC, Fraktion H, Piefkes, Ultras BFC, East Company, Riot Sport, Black Boys Dynamo, Bärenbande, Gegengerade, Hipstercrew, Märkische Jungs, Sektion Süddeutschland and Banda Invicta.[875][889][717][890] Supporter group Gegengerade is a left wing-oriented fan club.[890] A number of supporters BFC Dynamo had been members of the \\\"Anti-Fascist Football Fan Initiative\\\" (AFFI) aleady back in 1993.[891][892] Supporters of BFC Dynamo have occasionally displayed a Norwegian flag with the text \\\"Thanks Norway\\\", in memory of Norway\'s 2–0 win over Nazi Germany in the quarter-finals of the 1936 Summer Olympics. Another banner that has occasionally been displayed at the stadium contains the text \\\"There Is A Light That Never Goes Out\\\", with reference to the 1980s British cult band The Smiths.[893]\\n\\nUltras BFC announced its dissolution on 23 January 2023, after the group had lost essential material in an attack. An individual in the group was attacked by a group of people in front of his private residence and robbed of essential group material. The group apologized to the supporter scene of BFC Dynamo and consequently dissolved, but at the same time announced that this was not the end.[894] The attack has been traced to Cottbus.[895] A new supporter group named Banda Invicta eventually presented itself with a banner and a coreography on the first matchday of the 2023-24 Regionalliga Nordost on 29 July 2023. The coreography read \\\"On to a new chapter\\\".[896]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo had 100 Category C and 190 Category-B supporters in 2019.[897] Younger hooligans of BFC Dynamo have contacts with supporter group Kaliber 030 at Hertha.[637][898] 20–25 supporters of BFC Dynamo joined Hertha in the guest block of the Stadion an der Alten Försterei during the derby between Union Berlin and Hertha on 2 November 2019.[899] Older hooligans of BFC Dynamo, on the other hand, maintain friendly relationships with like-minded supporters of 1. FC Magdeburg.[637] Supporters of BFC Dynamo wanted to travel in numbers to the return leg against VfB Oldenburg in the promotion play-offs for the 3. Liga on 4 June 2022. Up to 2,500 supporters of BFC Dynamo wanted to join the team in Oldenburg.[900] Around 1,300 supporters of BFC Dynamo was eventually admitted to the Marschweg-Stadion, where they marked their presence with a banner, a scarf choreography and flares.[901][902][903]\\n\\nOne of the most well-known books in Germany about the supporter scene of BFC Dynamo is \\\"Der BFC war schuld am Mauerbau\\\" by German author Andreas Gläser (de). The book was first published in 2002 and describes the supporter scene from the late 1970s and forward. The club, its reputation and supporter scene, was also the theme of stage play \\\"Dynamoland\\\" by Gudrun Herrbold. The play was set up in 2007 and involved young football players from BFC Dynamo as well as Andreas Gläser.[784][520][904] The fanzine \\\"Zugriff\\\" is dedicated to BFC Dynamo. The fanzine has been produced by Andreas Gläser and members of supporter group Gegengerade since 2008.[905] The tenth and latest issue was published in 2014. The tenth issue came with as music CD mixed by Andreas Gläser. The CD included numerous ska and punk tracks as well as a 25 seconds long recording of Erich Mielke ranting about skinheads and punks.[749]\\n\\nMusicians from German rock band Klaus Renft Combo composed the anthem \\\"Auf, Dynamo!\\\" for BFC Dynamo in 1999.[906] German rap musician Joe Rilla has also dedicated a song to BFC Dynamo. The song is called \\\"Heb die Faust Hoch (BFC Dynamo Straßenhymne)\\\" and was released in 2008. Joe Rilla, whose real name is Hagen Stoll (de), has a background in the hooligan scene of BFC Dynamo.[907] The clothing store Hoolywood on Schönhauser Allee in Prenzlauer Berg is associated with the supporter scene of BFC Dynamo. The store was founded at the beginning of the 1990s.[752][904][908] The store has been an advertising partner of BFC Dynamo.[909]\\n\\nRivalries\\nSG Dynamo Dresden\\nThe oldest rival of BFC Dynamo is SG Dynamo Dresden. The rivalry dates back to 1954 when the team of Dynamo Dresden and its place in the DDR-Oberliga was transferred to SC Dynamo Berlin during the course of the 1954-55 season. The relocation aroused a sense of victimhood among the fans of Dynamo Dresden which would later be compounded by the successes of BFC Dynamo.[758] Matters were exacerbated when additional players of Dynamo Dresden were delegated to Dynamo Berlin by the German Football Association of the GDR (DFV) following the relegation of Dynamo Dresden after the 1962–63 season.[910] The antagonism between the two clubs was underpinned by a historical German rivalry between Prussian Berlin and Saxony.[719][911] It was fueled by contemporary resentment in Dresden at the better provision of housing and consumer goods in the East German capital.[719] East Berliners were generally unpopular outside the city limits, especially in the southern regional districts of East Germany. They were considered arrogant and clearly preferred.[751]\\n\\nDynamo Dresden slowly recovered from the relocation. The club was declared a regional district center of excellence (German: Leistungszentrum) by the regional district board of the DTSB on 5 August 1968.[912][913] The club could now draw on the best players in Bezirk Dresden.[912] Dynamo Dresden eventually re-established itself in the DDR-Oberliga and became campions once again in the 1970-71 DDR-Oberliga. BFC Dynamo and Dynamo Dresden then met in the final of the 1970-71 FDGB-Pokal. Klaus Sammer scored 1-0 for Dynamo Dresden, but Norbert Johannsen equalized on a penalty. Dynamo Dresden eventually won the match 2-1 after a second goal by Sammer in extra time.[57] Dynamo Dresden thus secured the first Double in the history of East German football.[914] However, BFC Dynamo did not go completely empty-handed from the final. The team qualified for its first UEFA competition as runners-up. Its participation in the 1971–72 European Cup Winners\' Cup would be a success.\\n\\n\\nA duel between Harald Schütze (left) and Reinhard Häfner of Dynamo Dresden (right) during a match between BFC Dynamo and Dynamo Dresden in the DDR-Oberliga in 1976.\\nBFC Dynamo met Dynamo Dresden away on the sixth matchday of the 1974-75 DDR-Oberliga on 21 September 1974. The standing was 2–2 at the end of the match, after an equalizer from Norbert Johannsen on a penalty. Shortly before the final whistle, referee Robert Pischke from Rostock awarded Dynamo Dresden a controversial penalty. Siegmar Wätzlich converted the penalty and Dynamo Dresden won the match 3–2.[915][916] The East German football weekly Die neue Fußballwoche (FuWo) commented: \\\"Shortly before the end, the same thing on the other side, but this one surprised even the objective Dresdeners about it. They hadn\'t seen any opposing influence on the falling Richter... The Berliners exploded in outrage at the penalty kick, which snatched a point from them in the last minute.\\\"[916] Dynamo Dresden finished the season in third place, two points ahead of BFC Dynamo. BFC Dynamo finished the season in fourth place, but with a better goal difference. Dynamo Dresden had thus captured the place in the 1975-76 UEFA Cup narrowly ahead of BFC Dynamo. Referee Pischke was not selected for any more DDR-Oberliga matches and eventually chose to end his refereeing career.[917] He would years later become the president of F.C. Hansa Rostock.[918]\\n\\nDynamo Dresden would come to dominate East German football in the 1970s. The team managed to capture a third consecutive league title in the 1977–78 DDR-Oberliga. What happened after is subject to various rumors. Formal title celebrations took place in June 1978 at the hotel and restaurant Bastein at Prager Straße in Dresden. Erich Mielke paid a visit as the president of SV Dynamo to congratulate the team to the title. Dynamo Dresden player Reinhard Häfner recalls how Mielke held a speech where he said that he would be happier if BFC Dynamo was champions. Mielke should have added that \\\"since BFC Dynamo is also SV Dynamo, the title stays in the family, so to speak, and that is good too\\\". According to other versions of the same event, he allegedly proclaimed that everything will be done so that in the coming year, the champion will come from Berlin, and that it was now the turn of the BFC Dynamo.[919][920][921][922][nb 15]\\n\\n\\nThomas Doll and defending Matthias Döschner of Dynamo Dresden during a match between Dynamo Dresden and BFC Dynamo in 1987.\\nBFC Dynamo stood out among other clubs within SV Dynamo. The club was located at the frontline of the Cold War. It was also a representative of the capital of East Germany. This meant that the club had to be well equipped.[67] BFC Dynamo would come to benefit from a nationwide scouting system, supported by 33 training centers (TZ) of SV Dynamo across East Germany.[68][927] No less than 40 full-time trainers worked for the club.[928] The team embarked on a period of unparalleled success in the 1978–79 season under young coach Jürgen Bogs. Dynamo Dresden had been the dominant team in East German football until then. BFC Dynamo would now be its main obstacle to success.[nb 16]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo opened the 1978-79 DDR-Oberliga with ten consecutive wins. The team thus broke the previous record of Dynamo Dresden of seven consecutive wins from the 1972-73 DDR-Oberliga. Dynamo Dresden, on the other hand, had a moderately successful start to the season and stood in second place. The two teams met in the 11th matchday in front of 33,000 spectators at Dynamo-Stadion in Dresden on 2 December 1978.[934] The match ended in a draw 1-1 after an equalizer by Hans-Jürgen Riediger for BFC Dynamo. The match was marked by crowd trouble, with 38 fans to both teams arrested.[4] 17 of the 38 fans arrested were fans of BFC Dynamo.[935] Inexperienced linesman Günter Supp should allegedly have missed an offside position on Riediger in the situation leading up to the equalizer.[936][937] There were accusations in Dresden that the match had been manipulated by the referees in favor of BFC Dynamo.[4][180][201] This alleged manipulation was cited as yet another example of discrimination against the Saxon city in comparison with East Berlin.[4][180] BFC Dynamo continued to lead the league for the rest of the season. The team finally secured its first DDR-Oberliga title after defeating Dynamo Dresden 3–1 in the 24th match day in front of 22,000 spectators at Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark on 6 June 1979.[938]\\n\\nThe 1979-80 DDR-Oberliga would be tight race between the two rivals. Dynamo Dresden led the league for most of the season. Dynamo Dresden was still in first place before the last matchday. However, BFC Dynamo was only one point behind. The two rivals met at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark in the last matchday of the league season on 10 May 1980. Dynamo Dresden only needed a draw to win the league title. There was huge excitement around the match and the stadium was sold out. Die neue Fußballwoche (FuWo) reported on \\\"international match atmosphere\\\".[939] The standing was 0-0 for a long time. Dynamo Dresden player Peter Kotte fell in the BFC Dynamo penalty area with about 15 minutes left of regular time, but Dynamo Dresden was denied a penalty.[940] Norbert Trieloff instead scored a goal for BFC Dynamo just a moment later. BFC Dynamo eventually won the match 1-0 and captured its second consecutive league title in front of 30,000 spectators. Dynamo Dresden would not come this close to BFC Dynamo in the league until the end of the 1980s. It was rumoured that referee Hans Kulicke from Oderberg had favored BFC Dynamo. However, also BFC Dynamo had been denied a chance to decide the match. A goal by Hartmut Pelka had been disallowed by referee Kulicke due to a foul on Dynamo Dresden goalkeeper Bernd Jakubowski.[921]\\n\\nBoth clubs were affiliated to SV Dynamo and supported by the security organs. However, BFC Dynamo was more associated with the Stasi, while Dynamo Dresden was more associated with the Volkspolizei.[941] BFC Dynamo was known as the favourite club of the head of the Stasi Erich Mielke.[942] Dynamo Dresden, on the other hand, was patronaged by Volkspolizei Lieutenant general Willi Nyffenegger. Nyffenegger was the long-time head of the regional district authority of the Volkspolizei in Bezirk Dresden.[943] However, also Dynamo Dresden had supporters in the Stasi. The Stasi had helped Dynamo Dresden to obtain secret information about the line-up of FC Bayern Munich before the match between Dynamo Dresden and FC Bayern Munich in the 1973–74 European Cup on 7 November 1973.[944] Dynamo Dresden would also be supported by Stasi Major general Horst Böhm in the 1980s.[945] Böhm was the head of the regional district administration of the Stasi in Bezirk Dresden.[946][947][758] He was a committed local patriot when it came to Dynamo Dresden and a sponsoring member of the club.[948][947][949] The antagonism between the two clubs also spread to the Stasi Guards Regiment \\\"Felix E. Dzerzhinsky\\\".[719][4] The behavior of members of a Dresden unit during a match between the two teams in 1985 was likened to that of \\\"rioting fans\\\" by another Stasi officer.[719] Some Stasi guards had hurled abuse at BFC Dynamo players, shouting \\\"Bent champions!\\\" as they left the pitch.[758]\\n\\nResentment in Dresden over the rise of BFC Dynamo was worsened when three top players of Dynamo Dresden, Gerd Weber, Peter Kotte and Matthias Müller, were arrested on suspicion of planning to defect to West Germany in 1981.[950][4] Weber had solicited plans to defect, but the other two had not.[951] Weber received a prison sentence and a lifetime ban from playing football at any level in East Germany, while Kotte and Müller received lifetime bans from playing in the top two tiers for alleged complicity.[950][4][952] Neither would return to the Oberliga. The punishment against the three players led to rumors and protests in Dresden.[950] They also fueled local patriotism and anti-Berlin sentiments in Dresden.[950]\\n\\nFans of Dynamo Dresden saw the lifetime bans on Weber, Kotte and Müller as \\\"an order from Erich Mielke\\\" designed to weaken Dynamo Dresden.[950] Also, Kotte and Klaus Sammer has claimed they were part of a delibate plan by Mielke to weaken Dynamo Dresden.[953][954] However, such claims are doubtful.[953] The three players had been reported by an unofficial collaborator (IM) and Mielke was convinced that all three were originally prepared to defect.[951][953] Kotte was not an isolated case. The great fear of footballers, fans and officials who had fled East Germany was omnipresent at the Stasi.[955] Kotte and Müller knew about the intentions of Weber.[950] Their failure to inform authorities was critical.[950] Former SED First Secretary in Bezik Dresden Hans Modrow concludes that the measures against the three were \\\"generally cautious\\\", given the completely different consequences for other East German citizens in similar contexts. After all, the three were also members of the armed organs (German: Bewaffnete Organe der DDR) with ranks.[956] Müller said in an interview with Dresdner Neueste Nachrichten in 2011 that he \\\"knew one hundred percent\\\" that the uncompromising actions against the three players were a deliberate attempt by the Stasi to weaken Dynamo Dresden in order to secure the supremacy of BFC Dynamo.[957]\\n\\n\\nBFC Dynamo midfielder Bernd Schulz celebrates a goal against Dynamo Dresden in the DFV-Supercup together with Thomas Doll (left) and Jörg Fügner (right) in 1989.\\nBFC Dynamo and Dynamo Dresden would be the two main contenders for titles in East German football during the 1980s. BFC Dynamo dominated the DDR-Oberliga and won consecutive titles, while Dynamo Dresden had major success in the FDGB-Pokal. The two teams met in the 1981-82 FDGB-Pokal and 1983-84 FDGB-Pokal final. Dynamo Dresden won both finals and thus stopped BFC Dynamo from completing the Double.[940] The teams then also met in the 1984-85 FDGB-Pokal final. The performance of the referees in the final was controversial. A review by the DFV found that 30 percent of the referee decisions during the match had been wrong, and that 80 percent of those had been of disadvantage to Dynamo Dresden.[958] Referee Manfred Roßner was banned one year from officiating matches above second tier after the final.[959][960][958] However, nothing emerged that indicated that Roßner had been bought by the Stasi.[961] Dynamo Dresden won the final 3–2 in front of 48,000 spectators at the Stadion der Weltjugend. It was the fourth loss for BFC Dynamo against Dynamo Dresden in the final of the FDGB-Pokal and the third time that Dynamo Dresden had stopped the team from completing the Double.[940] However, BFC Dynamo would eventually succeed in completing the Double in the 1987–88 season, defeating FC Carl Zeiss Jena 2–0 in final of the 1987–88 FDGB-Pokal.\\n\\nDisturbances by spectators was a regular occurrence at matches between the two teams.[758] BFC Dynamo was met by immense hostility during away matches in Dresden. Fans of BFC Dynamo would respond to the hatred they met by singing chants in praise of Erich Mielke as a provocation.[758][178] They also made fun of the food shortage in Dresden.[753] Fans of BFC Dynamo are known to have brought coveted tropical fruits, that were only available in East Berlin, to away matches in Saxony. The fruits were then thrown at the home crowd.[178][753][751][nb 17] In Dresden they threw green bananas at the home fans and shouted: \\\"We brought you something - Bananas, bananas!\\\".[753] East German state television would always try to hide riots from viewers and sound engineers also had to drown out chants that were considered negative, such as \\\"Stasi out\\\". The match between BFC Dynamo and SG Dynamo Dresden was the most explosive encounter. At one point, the match between BFC Dynamo and SG Dynamo Dresden was even ordered to be recorded completely without sound.[776] A group of about 250 hooligans of Dynamo Dresden chanted anti-Semitic slogans against BFC Dynamo, such as \\\"Berlin Jews!\\\" and \\\"Jews\' sow!, during the match between the two teams in the 1987-88 DDR-Oberliga in East Berlin on 6 April 1988.[792][963] A number of supporters of SG Dynamo Dresden were then allegedly arrested after the match.[963]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo\'s ten-year dominance in the league was eventually broken by Dynamo Dresden in the 1988–89 season. BFC Dynamo won a second consecutive cup title in the 1988-89 FDGB-Pokal, but Dynamo Dresden became the new champion in the 1988-89 DDR-Oberliga. BFC Dynamo and Dynamo Dresden then met in the first ever DFV-Supercup in 1989. BFC Dynamo won the match 4–1 in front of 22,347 spectators at the Stadion der Freundschaft in Cottbus and became the first and only winner of the DFV-Supercup in the history of East German football.\\n\\nBFC Dynamo and Dynamo Dresden met 60 times in the Oberliga, FDGB-Pokal and DFV-Supercup between 1966 and 1991. BFC Dynamo won 21 matches and Dynamo Dresden won 27 matches. BFC Dynamo and Dynamo Dresden also met 10 times in the Regionalliga Nordost between 1995 and 2000. BFC Dynamo won 3 matches and Dynamo Dresden won 5 matches. The last meeting ended 1–1 and took place in the 1999-00 Regionalliga Nordost on 26 April 2000. The two teams rarely meet these days, because Dynamo Dresden regularly appears in the second or third tier of the German football league system. Former Dynamo Dresden player Ralf Minge expressed in an interview in 2018 his satisfaction that Dynamo Dresden has advanced past BFC Dynamo, but also said that he would not mind new duels with BFC Dynamo and that duels with BFC Dynamo \\\"have a certain charm\\\".[964]\\n\\n1. FC Union Berlin\\nFurther information: Berlin derby\\nBFC Dynamo and 1. FC Union Berlin were founded only a few days apart. Both clubs were formed during the reorganization of East German football in December 1965 and January 1966, when the football departments of ten sports clubs (SC) were reorganized into dedicated football clubs.[965] However, Union Berlin was not part of the original plan. Two football clubs had already been planned for East Berlin. They were to be formed from the football departments of SC Dynamo Berlin and ASK Vorwärts Berlin.[64] In addition, TSC Berlin played only in the second tier DDR-Liga at the time.[965][64] The founding of Union Berlin probably owed much to the intervention of the powerful Herbert Warnke.[965][762][966] Herbert Warnke was the chairman of the national state trade union FDGB and a member of the SED Politburo.[965] Dynamo Berlin and Vorwärts Berlin were both associated with the armed and security organs.[965][64] Herbert Warnke therefore argued for the formation of a civilian club for the working people of East Berlin.[965][64] He would be a passionate fan of Union Berlin.[967] Another high-ranking SED politician who pushed for the founding a civilian football club in East Berlin was the SED First Secretary in East Berlin and SED Politburo member Paul Verner.[968] Verner held a speech at the founding ceremony of Union Berlin.[969]\\n\\nBoth BFC Dynamo and Union Berlin belonged to the elite in East German football.[762][970] The new football clubs were intended as centers of excellence, with the right to draw on talents within designated geographical areas.[4][64] BFC Dynamo was supported by the Stasi, while Union Berlin was supported by the FDGB.[971][972][nb 18] However, Union Berlin was able to trace its origins back to FC Olympia Oberschöneweide in 1906.[753] BFC Dynamo had no history before East Germany. The supporters of Union Berlin therefore considered their club to be a genuine football club, unlike BFC Dynamo.[762] However, even as a civilian club, Union Berlin was also part of the sports political system.[177][975][65] The founding of the Union Berlin was organized by the then SED First Secretary in Köpenick Hans Modrow.[976] Like Herbert Warnke, Hans Modrow would be a sponsoring member of the club.[971][976] The most important positions on the board of Union Berlin were exclusively held by directors of state-owned factories or SED representatives.[65] Union Berlin was state-funded and all decisions in club had to be reported to the all-powerful central sports agency DTSB.[975] The DTSB stood in turn under direct control of the SED Central Committee.[977]\\n\\nThe rivalry between BFC Dynamo and Union Berlin began in the mid-1960s. It was initially based on the geographical proximity to each other.[66] BFC Dynamo and Union Berlin were two clubs from East Berlin in the DDR-Oberliga.[66] BFC Dynamo struggled in the 1966-67 DDR-Oberliga and was threatened with relegation. The feud between the two clubs began when fans of Union Berlin mocked BFC Dynamo with a banner saying \\\"We greet the relegated\\\" during a league match at the Stadion an der Alten Försterei on 26 April 1967.[45][972] Union Berlin won the match by 3–0 and BFC Dynamo was eventually relegated to the DDR-Liga at the end of the season.[45] While BFC Dynamo was playing in the second tier DDR-Liga, Union Berlin surprisingly won the 1967–68 FDGB-Pokal.[762] However, BFC Dynamo immediately bounced back and managed to establish itself in the DDR-Oberliga. Union Berlin would then itself be relegated to the DDR-Liga after the 1968-69 DDR-Oberliga, but also managed to return to the DDR-Oberliga after just one season in the second tier. Union Berlin would be the stronger of the two teams until the 1970s.[978]\\n\\nThe rivalry between the two clubs intensified in the early 1970s.[66] The player of Union Berlin, Klaus Korn, was suspended after a heated derby in the 1970–71 DDR-Oberliga at the Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum on 28 October 1970.[66][45] The performance of the referees had been \\\"catastrophic\\\" according to private notes from the then Second Club Secretary and Vice President of Union Berlin Günter Mielis, and the match ended with riots.[66][979][980] Klaus Korn had insulted players in BFC Dynamo with slurs such as \\\"Stasi-pig\\\". The DFV Legal Commission imposed a one-year ban on Klaus Korn after a circumstantial trial.[981][982] The DFV Legal Commission also demanded that Union Berlin considered his exclusion from the club. Klaus Korn was then excluded from the club and would never play in the DDR-Oberliga again.[981][982][66][45] Unrest broke out again at a derby in Hohenschönhausen one year later. Eight spectators were arrested after the match between BFC Dynamo and Union Berlin in the 1971–72 DDR-Oberliga at the Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum on 28 December 1971.[983] The match was attended by 14,000 spectators and the stadium was sold out.[984][712]\\n\\nThe football landscape in East Berlin changed before the 1971–72 season. Vorwärts Berlin was relocated to Frankfurt an der Oder on 31 July 1971. BFC Dynamo and Union Berlin were from now on the only major football clubs in East Berlin.[985] The relocation meant that BFC Dynamo could now take over the role of the dominant team for the armed organs in East Berlin. The team would also have opportunity to eventually move into the larger and more centrally located Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark, which led to increased interest in the club and growing attendance numbers.[66] The districts in East Berlin had previously been divided between BFC Dynamo, Vorwärts Berlin and Union Berlin. Each club was able to recruit young players from training centers (TZ) in their districts.[64][65] All training centers that had previously belonged to Vorwärts Berlin were now given to BFC Dynamo.[64][65] The DTSB allegedly saw more potential in BFC Dynamo.[64] BFC Dynamo now had access to two thirds of all training centers (TZ) in East Berlin.[65][35] This meant that BFC Dynamo had gained a much stronger position in East Berlin than Union Berlin when it came to recruiting young players.[978] FC Vorwärts Frankfurt was given Bezirk Potsdam as a catchment area, in addition to Bezirk Frankfurt. Bezirk Potsdam had previously been assigned to Union Berlin and thus had to be handed over to Vorwärts Frankfurt. This further weakened Union Berlin in relation to BFC Dynamo.[986][65][nb 19]\\n\\nUnion Berlin was relegated to the DDR-Liga after the 1972–73 season. The Union Berlin star and national team player Reinhard Lauck was transferred to BFC Dynamo after the relegation.[987] The loss of Lauck was a hard blow for the team. Lauck had contributed greatly to the victory in the final of the 1967–68 FDGB-Pokal and was well-liked among the supporters of Union Berlin.[987] Supporters of Union Berlin are said to have gathered outside his apartment, to appeal to him to stay in the team and play in the second tier.[988][989] But Lauck had already decided to change team.[988][990] The DFV had allegedly advised him to switch to BFC Dynamo in order to continue playing in the national team.[987] According to a regulation in the 1970 DFV Football Resolution (German: DFV-Fußballbeschluss), national team players in clubs that had been relegated from the DDR-Oberliga should switch clubs in order to remain competitive.[991] Lauck would make a successful appearance for East Germany in the 1974 FIFA World Cup and would win gold with East Germany in the 1976 Summer Olympics.[987][989] Lauck became the team captain of BFC Dynamo in the 1974–75 season.[82] He would later win two league titles with BFC Dynamo before ending his career due to a knee injury.[989][992]\\n\\nUnion Berlin would remain in the DDR-Liga for several seasons. Instead of playing matches against BFC Dynamo in the DDR-Oberliga, the team was now left to compete with the reserve team of BFC Dynamo, the BFC Dynamo II. Union Berlin would also suffer more blows which further weakened its position in relation to BFC Dynamo. Herbert Warnke passed in 1975 and was replaced as chairman of the FDGB by Harry Tisch.[971] Harry Tisch had begun his political career in Rostock and chose instead to give the support of the FDGB to F.C. Hansa Rostock.[971] Union Berlin thus lost the support of the FDGB and also no longer had any support in the top of the political hierarchy.[993] From no on, the club could only rely on support from the district administration of the SED in East Berlin and local state-owned enterprises, such as VEB Kabelwerk Oberspree (KWO) and VEB Transformatorenwerk Oberschöneweide (TRO).[994][971]\\n\\nThe DTSB and the DFV had also continued their efforts to concentrate resources on a few clubs during the 1970s.[995] A number of football clubs became specially promoted focus clubs in the 1970 DFV Football Resolution.[60][996] The focus clubs were meant to be strengthened through player transfers. Players in teams that had been relegated from the DDR-Oberliga should also switch to focus clubs.[997] The focus clubs were also equipped with more staff as well as better material and technical conditions.[998][60][996] BFC Dynamo became the focus club in East Berlin.[999][1000][995][nb 20] Even more advantages were then given to the focus clubs in the 1976 DFV Football Resolution. The focus clubs would now be allowed to delegate youth players from other football clubs. They would also be provided with more youth coaches from the DFV and have the right to accommodate twice as many students in their affiliated Children and Youth Sports Schools (KJS) every year, compared to other football clubs.[1001][999][1002] Union Berlin would now have to delegate some of its best young players to BFC Dynamo.[978][nb 21] One example was the talented Detlef Helms, who was delegated to BFC Dynamo as a 17-year-old in 1977.[65][970]\\n\\nUnion Berlin returned to the Oberliga in the 1976–77 season. Stadion an der Alten Försterei was a small football stadium without cinder tracks where the crowd stood close to the pitch.[762][990] Union Berlin had become the focus of hooligan attention.[719] Matches at the Stadion an der Alten Föresterei had regularly been interrupted by spectators throwing objects on the pitch.[1003] The derby between BFC Dynamo and Union Berlin was now such as heated affair that the matches were moved by the DFV to the neutral Stadion der Weltjugend in Mitte.[1004] It was considered that safety could not be guaranteed with the larger number of spectators.[1005][1006][719][762] The Stadion an der Alten Försterei was known for its atmosphere and the Stadion der Weltjugend was located only a few minutes away from the home district of BFC Dynamo.[990][66] The move was therefore seen as a major disadvantage by the fans to Union Berlin and further diluted their aversion to BFC Dynamo.[45][66][nb 22] Union Berlin defeated BFC Dynamo 1–0 in front of 45,000 spectators at the Stadion der Weltjugend in the first meeting of the 1976–77 season on 4 September 1976.[1008][294][95] Union Berlin also won the return match on 19 February 1977.[95] The two wins against BFC Dynamo during the 1976–77 season cemented the reputation of Union Berlin as a cult club and crowd puller.[1009]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo established itself as one of the top teams in the DDR-Oberliga from the mid-1970s. Union Berlin would come to play second fiddle in East Berlin from now on and never finish higher than seventh place in the DDR-Oberliga.[1010] In the shadow of BFC Dynamo, Union Berlin would no longer have any major sporting significance in East Germany.[1011] Union Berlin became a yo-yo team that hovered between the Oberliga and the DDR-Liga.[1010] Supporters of Union Berlin saw BFC Dynamo as the highest representative of the security organs and the police, with privileges in player recruitment and financial support as well as the political clout of Mielke.[762] This was supposedly in contrast to their own club, which they regarded as an underdog rooted in the working class.[762][719][1012][753] BFC Dynamo would be disliked all over East Germany for its successes and its connection to the Stasi.[910][137][38] This was also reflected in the derby between BFC Dynamo and Union Berlin.[137] The supporters of Union Berlin were seen as oppositional.[137] This is illustrated in the famous sentence of the editor-in-chief of the satirical magazine Eulenspiegel: \\\"Not all Union fans are enemies of the state, but all enemies of the state are Union fans.\\\"[137][1013] But the fact that people supported Union Berlin did not automatically mean that they were against the state.[177] Union Berlin got a lot of sympathy as the weaker club.[177][1014] There was a simple rule in East German football, where the least privileged club got the most sympathy.[178] Supporters of Union Berlin cultivated the image of their club as the eternal underdog.[762][1015]\\n\\nClashes between the supporters of the two teams became increasingly common in the 1970s. Union Berlin had one of the most notorious followings in East Germany at this time.[32] The supporters of Union Berlin often went to away matches in large numbers.[32] Fights were initially won by the supporters of Union Berlin. They were in the clear majority and could chase the supporters of BFC Dynamo from the streets.[972] A punch in the face and a stolen scarf was an experience for many young supporters of BFC Dynamo at this time.[990] But BFC Dynamo gained more and more young supporters with its growing successes in the late 1970s.[174] Many came from working-class families in Prenzlauer Berg.[749] The supporters of BFC Dynamo would eventually begin to appear extremely well organized and by the early 1980s they began to fight back.[972][32] The tide now turned and the supporters of BFC Dynamo would win all fights between the supporters of the two teams from now on.[972][990] Derbies at the Stadion der Weltjugend usually ended with a couple of hundred supporters of BFC Dynamo chasing the supporters of Union Berlin along Chausseestraße down towards the Friedrichsstrasse S-Bahn station.[1016][32][1017] The fights often continued on the side streets of Friedrichstraße.[1017]\\n\\nUnion Berlin is sometimes portrayed as having been an opponent of the East German system and derbies between BFC Dynamo and Union Berlin during the East German era have been hyped as some kind of domestic political showdown.[1018] But Union Berlin was mostly just a club struggling against unfavorable conditions.[1018] The club had become disadvantaged by the state sports politics compared to local rival BFC Dynamo.[1018] Honorary President of Union Berlin Günter Mielis has said: \\\"Union was not a club of resistance fighters, but we had to fight against a lot of political and economic resistance over and over again. We got strength from our fans\\\".[1019] However, Union Berlin would eventually become known for a supporter scene that was anti-establishment, where dissidents could vent their disdain for the system in the anonymity of a crowd.[1010] Supporters of Union Berlin also saw themselves as stubborn and non-conformist, but this image should not be confused with actual resistance.[38] Provocation was part of football in East Germany and people shouted out anything, because it was possible to get away with it.[1020] A critical attitude to the system was something that football supporters across East Germany had in common in the 1970s and 1980s.[1021]\\n\\nSupporters of Union Berlin from the East German era concede that it is an exaggeration to call the club a \\\"resistance club\\\".[1022][970] A supporter of Union Berlin has said: \\\"With the best of intentions, Union fans did not contribute to the overthrow of the GDR. No way, we were interested in football. There is the cliché about the club for the enemies of the state, but that wasn\'t us\\\".[1023] There were no political groups among the supporters of Union Berlin.[1024] For some supporters of Union Berlin, the dissident reputation of Union Berlin is a legend that was created after Die Wende.[1022] A controversy erupted around Union Berlin in 2011 when it became publicly known that the then President of Union Berlin Dirk Zingler had been a member of the Stasi Guards Regiment \\\"Felix E. Dzerzhinsky\\\" for three years during his military service between 1983 and 1986.[1025][1026] Zingler explained that he had sought to spend his military service in Berlin and claimed that he did not know beforehand that the regiment belonged to the Stasi.[1027] However, the Stasi Guards Regiment \\\"Felix E. Dzerzhinsky\\\" was an elite formation; it was not possible to simply apply for the regiment. The Stasi selected who it thought were best fit to serve with the regiment, only accepting recruits that were \\\"loyal to the line\\\".[1027][1028] Zingler had also been a member of the Socialist Unity Party (SED) and leader in the Free German Youth (FDJ) at the time.[1029][1028] Union Berlin Press spokesman Christian Arbeit commented on the reports about Zingler in 2011 saying: \\\"We do have a very unique history, compared to other clubs. But it wasn\'t us that always claimed we were this big anti-Stasi club. These are stories that get simplified in the media.\\\"[1026]\\n\\nMost supporters of Union Berlin were just normal football supporters.[1020] Politics was not in the foreground.[970] Supporters of Union Berlin from the era have testified that their support for the club had nothing to do with politics.[1030] The club was the most important thing and the identification with Union Berlin had primarily to do with Köpenick.[1030][1031] The rivalry was fueled by local pride from the supporters of the two teams.[1032] However, the political dimension was there nonetheless.[1010] BFC Dynamo was supported by the Stasi, who was disliked by many.[1010] But above all, it was the political instrumentalization of football that irritated supporters of Union Berlin.[1033] The political favoritism of BFC Dynamo greatly contributed to the enthusiasm of the supporters of Union Berlin.[972] Supporters of Union Berlin embraced the image of the underdog fighting the odds.[1004] An expression of the supporters of Union Berlin was: \\\"Better to be a loser than a stupid Stasi pig\\\".[1011]\\n\\nThe derby between BFC Dynamo and Union Berlin was first and foremost a local football derby.[1010] Both clubs had supporters who were not loyal to the line.[1024][1034][751] Also supporters of BFC Dynamo were observed by the Stasi during the 1980s.[1035] East Berlin was divided into two: BFC Dynamo was more strongly represented in some parts, and Union Berlin was more strongly represented in other parts.[972] Which team you supported was very much a question of where you lived.[32] BFC Dynamo was the local team if you grew up in Prenzlauer Berg.[1036] And you lived in Mitte, you were also more likely to be a supporter BFC Dynamo, as the home stadium was only a stone\'s throw away along Schönhauser Allee.[32] But Mitte was also a contested area.[759] The border allegedly ran at Alexanderplatz, where many fights between the supporters of the two teams were fought.[972][760] The home districts of the two clubs, Hohenschönhausen and Köpenick respectively, were always dangerous territory for supporters of the other team.[972]\\n\\n\\nBFC Dynamo midfielder Bernd Schulz (right) celebrating together with team captain Frank Rohde (left) after scoring a goal against 1. FC Union Berlin at the Stadion der Weltjugend on 18 March 1989.\\nBFC Dynamo and Union Berlin met a total of 35 times in the DDR-Oberliga and the FDGB-Pokal. BFC Dynamo won 22 meetings and Union Berlin won 6 meetings. Matches against Union Berlin was often won with big numbers in the late 1970s and 1980s.[45][203] BFC Dynamo defeated Union Berlin with 1–8 and then 7–1 in the round of 16 of the 1978-79 FDGB-Pokal.[45] Hans-Jürgen Riediger scored a hat-trick in both legs.[1037][1038] BFC Dynamo also defeated Union Berlin 8–1 in the Oberliga on 13 September 1986. Thom, Frank Pastor and Christian Backs scored two goals each.[1039] The 1980s was a crushing win for BFC Dynamo. Former BFC Dynamo midfielder Falko Götz concluded that: \\\"Union was no opponent to us\\\".[1016] The two teams met 13 times in the Oberliga and FDGB-Pokal during the 1980s. BFC Dynamo won 11 matches and two matches ended in a draw. The matches between the two local rivals were hard-fought on the pitch.[294] Former BFC Dynamo midfielder Frank Terletzki has said that the victories against Union Berlin were always the best.[203] But despite the rivalry between the clubs, it happened that players hung out outside of football.[1040] Former BFC Dynamo defender Frank Rohde has said that players of BFC Dynamo and Union Berlin often gathered to have a beer together after matches.[294]\\n\\nThere were several transfers between the two clubs. BFC Dynamo recruited some of the best players of Union Berlin, such as Reinard Lauck in 1973, Detlef Helms in 1977 and Waldemar Ksienzyk in 1984.[45][970] But there were also transfers in the other direction. Union Berlin predecessor TSC Oberschöneweide recruited Ralf Quest from SC Dynamo Berlin in 1962. Quest scored the winning goal for Union Berlin in the final of the 1967-68 FDGB-Pokal, when the club won a sensational cup victory.[1041] Union Berlin would then recruit several players from BFC Dynamo over the years, such as Werner Heine in 1966, Werner Voigt, Bernd Kempke and Michael Jakob in 1973, Rainer Rohde in 1976, Rainer Wroblewski in 1977, Olaf Seier in 1983, Ralf Sträßer in 1984, Olaf Hirsch in 1986, Norbert Trieloff in 1987, Mario Maek in 1988, and Marco Kostmann and Thomas Grether in 1989, and Bernd Schulz in 1990.[95][970][294][1042] Union Berlin recruited a couple of players from BFC Dynamo in the 1980s who did some of their best seasons at the club.[1043][990] Olaf Seier became the team captain of Union Berlin and Ralf Sträßer became first and only player in Union Berlin to ever become league top goal scorer during the East German era.[65] Mario Maek saved Union Berlin from relegation with a late 3–2 goal against FC Karl-Marx-Stadt in the last match day of the 1987-88 DDR-Oberliga.[970][1044] As many as three former players of BFC Dynamo were involved in the winning goal for Union Berlin.[1044]\\n\\n\\nSupporters of FC Berlin during a match against 1. FC Union Berlin at the Stadion an der Alten Försterei on 23 September 1990.\\nUnion Berlin played in the DDR-Liga in the 1989–90 season. FC Berlin and Union Berlin met in the second round of the 1990-91 FDGB-Pokal at the Stadion an der Alten Försterei on 23 September 1990. It was the first match between the teams since the fall of the Berlin Wall. BFC Dynamo, now named FC Berlin, had now already lost many of its former top-performers to the West German Bundesliga.[1045][809] Union Berlin was now coached by the former BFC Dynamo player and youth coach Werner Voigt.[1046] Hooligans of FC Berlin stormed the home stands armed with clubs and flares and attacked supporters of Union Berlin at the beginning of the match.[263][809] Union Berlin won the match 2–1 on extra-time.[809] It was the first win for Union Berlin against FC Berlin since 1977.[263] Thomas Grether scored the first goal and Olaf Seier scored the winning goal for Union Berlin in the match. Both players had been brought up in the youth department of BFC Dynamo and had played matches for BFC Dynamo in the DDR-Oberliga.[809] Clashes between supporters of the two teams continued in the city after the match. Serious riots broke out in East Berlin, involving hundreds of supporters.[811]\\n\\nFC Berlin and Union Berlin then met in the promotion round to the 2. Bundesliga in the 1990–91 season. FC Berlin lost the first match 1–0 away in the second round at the Stadion an der Alten Försterei on 8 June 1991. Former BFC Dynamo player Bernd Schulz scored the winning goal for Union Berlin.[1047] FC Berlin then defeated Union Berlin 2–0 in the return match in fifth round in front of 9,475 spectators at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark on 18 June 1991. Heiko Bonan and Thorsten Boer scored one goal each in the match.[1048] FC Berlin was only one point behind leader BSG Stahl Brandenburg before the last round. The team managed to defeat Magdeburg 3–5 away on 23 June 1991. However, BSG Stahl Brandenburg defeated Union Berlin 2–0 away. FC Berlin thus finished in second place and missed promotion. Some supporters of BFC Dynamo are convinced that Union Berlin deliberately lost in order to prevent FC Berlin from advancing to the 2. Bundesliga.[257] FC Berlin and Union Berlin then also met in the promotion round for the 2. Bundesliga in 1991–92 season. FC Berlin won the first match 3–0 at home in the third round on 31 May 1992. The team then also won the return match 0–4 away in the fourth round on 7 June 1992.\\n\\nThe two teams met again in the new Regionalliga Nordost that was formed in 1994–95 season. Werner Voigt became the new coach of FC Berlin during the 1995–96 season. Voigt had a long history with BFC Dynamo but also had history with Union Berlin. Voigt had played for Union Berlin between 1973 and 1975 and had coached the team between 1990 and 1992.[1046] FC Berlin under coach Voigt lost 0–6 to 1. FC Union Berlin in the 1996–97 Regionalliga Nordost at the Stadion im Sportforum on 28 September 1996. It was the biggest defeat so far to Union Berlin.[294] Former FC Berlin player Thorsten Boer scored two goals for Union Berlin in the match.[1049] The two teams met 12 times in total in Regionalliga Nordost between 1994 and 2000. BFC Dynamo won one match and Union Berlin won eight matches. The two teams then met in the round of 16 of the 2000-01 Berlin Cup. The match was played in front of 4,427 spectators at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark on 24 March 2001.[351] Union Berlin won the match 0–3. Riots broke out among supporters of BFC Dynamo in Prenzlauer Berg after the match. The police had to deploy water cannons to control the situation.[855] The most recent meetings between BFC Dynamo and Union Berlin occurred in the 2005–06 NOFV-Oberliga Nord. The first match was played at the Stadion an der Alten Försterei on 21 August 2005. BFC Dynamo was missing striker Danny Kukulies and first-choice goalkeeper Nico Thomaschewski before the match. Kukulies was suspended and Thomaschewski injured.[1050][1051] German police and members of the SEK carried out a controversial raid against supporters of BFC Dynamo the night before the match.[440] Club management initially considered withdrawing from the match. The players voted on whether or not to play the match against Union Berlin.[865] More than 1,000 police officers were deployed to the match.[1016] BFC Dynamo eventually lost 8–0.[970] The return match was played at the Stadion im Sportforum on 13 May 2006. The score was 1–1 when around 200 supporters of BFC Dynamo stormed the pitch to attack supporters of Union Berlin.[456][871][873] Supporters of Union Berlin fled the guest block in panic.[872] The match was abandoned and Union Berlin was awarded a 2–0 victory.[871][873] The two teams has not met since then.\\n\\nBFC Dynamo met the reserve team of Union Berlin six times in the NOFV-Oberliga Nord and Regionalliga Nordost between 2010 and 2015. Union Berlin II won the first five matches. The last match was played in the 2014-15 Regionalliga Nordost on 15 March 2015. BFC Dynamo defeated Union Berlin II 1–0 in front of 8,169 spectators at Stadion an der Alten Försterei. The match was interrupted for 18 minutes when supporters of Union Berlin tried to attack the supporters of BFC Dynamo.[552][1052][45] 112 police officers were injured and 175 supporters were arrested during the match.[1053][45] Some media reported that 300 supporters of Union Berlin had participated in the attack on guest supporters. Journalist Frank Willmann attended the match and claims that the number was rather 30. He also said he did not see any injured police.[1052] There have been several cases of violence between the supporters of the two teams during the 2010s.[1054] Around a hundred hooligans from Union Berlin tried to attack a senior tournament organized by BFC Dynamo in the Dynamo-Sporthalle on 30 January 2010.[1055][1056][1057][875] Also women and children got in the way of the attack.[1057] Around 30 partially masked supporters from Union Berlin attacked players and a small group of supporters of BFC Dynamo in connection with a senior match between Union Berlin and BFC Dynamo at the Sportanlage Hämmerlingstraße in Köpenick on 27 March 2015.[1058][45][1054] One player of BFC Dynamo and two guest spectators were injured.[45] A number of supporters of BFC Dynamo joined Hertha BSC in the guest block of the Stadion an der Alten Försterei during the derby between Union Berlin and Hertha BSC on 2 November 2019.[899]\\n\\nOrganization\\nCurrent board and management\\nAs of 1 August 2023[1059][1060][1061][1062][1063]\\nBerliner Fussball Club Dynamo e.

The U17 team competes in the third tier B-Junior Verbandsliga Berlin and the U19 team competes in second tier A-Junior Regionalliga Nordost.[1094] The youth teams are based in the Sportforum Hohenschönhausen.[637]\\n\\nThere were more than 800 children and youth players in the club as of 2019.[1095] Many children in the club comes from immigrant backgrounds or socially disadvantaged families.[637][1096][626][753][608][634] BFC Dynamo helped football club FC Berlin 23 from neighbouring Storkower Straße in September 2021 and saved more than 40 to 50 children from the club, which was about to be dissolved.[608]\\n\\nThe club launched the so-called \\\"Kita-projekt\\\" in 2003.[637] The Kita-projekt is a day care project that gives boys and girls aged 3 to 6 the opportunity to participate in sports on a regular basis.[637][1097] The Kita-projekt involved approximately 200 children from 16 day care centers in Berlin as of 2020.[1096] The majority of the children come from the localities or former boroughs of Lichtenberg, Hohenschönhausen, Karlshorst, Mitte, Weißensee and Pankow.[1097] The Kita-projekt was the first of its kind in Germany and has received several awards for its work with children.[637][1098][1099] The former professional player of BFC Dynamo Jörn Lenz is the head of the Kita-projekt as of 2021.[1099]\\n\\nThe so-called \\\"Jugendförderverein\\\" was founded in 2004.[426] It is a registered voluntary association that aims to promote youth sports at BFC Dynamo. The Jugendförderverein has supported youth teams with equipment, covered costs for trips to tournaments and helped youth trainers to be able to obtain their trainer license. The Jugendförderverein relies on donations and voluntary work.[1100] Former Club President Mario Weinkauf was one of the seven founding members of the Jugenförderverein and briefly served as chairman of the association before he became club president. Weinkauf had also been a youth trainer in the club for some time.[426]\\n\\nYouth academy during East German era\\nBFC Dynamo had a very successful youth academy during the East German era.[1016][174][201] The youth department had full-time trainers available for all youth classes and access to the best material conditions in the Dynamo-Sportforum.[105][1101] There were no less than 40 full-time trainers in the club.[928] Youth coaches were highly qualified and training in the Children and Youth Sports School (KJS) was extensive.[1102][1103] The youth work at BFC Dynamo during the East German era was described as \\\"absolutely leading\\\" by former coach Jürgen Bogs, who had a background as coach of the junior team.[105][1101] It was also described as \\\"exquisite\\\" by former German sports journalist Horst Friedemann, who worked for Deutsches Sportecho and Kicker.[201]\\n\\nThe upper tier of elite clubs in East Germany had privileged access to talents within designated geographical and administrative areas.[4][1104] All designated football clubs were assigned one or two regional districts in East Germany as catchment areas at their founding in 1965–1966. BFC Dynamo was initially assigned Bezirk Cottbus and one third of the districts in East Berlin.[35][65] The club was later allowed to take over the training centers (German: Trainingszentrum) (TZ) in East Berlin that had previously belonged to the catchment area of FC Vorwärts Berlin, when FC Vorwärts Berlin was relocated to Frankfurt an der Oder before the 1971-72 season.[64][65]\\n\\nHowever, BFC Dynamo, as well as FC Vorwärts Berlin and SG Dynamo Dresden, also had another structural advantage when it came to recruiting talents.[1105] Most sports associations (German: Sportvereinigung) (SV) were dissolved at the founding of the DTSB in 1957.[1106] However, sports associations SV Dynamo and ASV Vorwärts were allowed to continue exist.[1107] A decision in the SED Politburo in 1962 then stipulated that the sports associations SV Dynamo and ASV Vorwärts were allowed to set up sports communities in each location where they operated offices. This meant that SV Dynamo and ASV Vorwärts would be able to run sports communities across the country.[1108] BFC Dynamo would eventually be able recruit talents from the youth departments of all sports communities (German: Sportgemeinschaft) (SG) of SV Dynamo in East Germany, except those in Bezirk Dresden and a number of other sports communities in the southern regional districts that belonged to the catchment area of SG Dynamo Dresden.[105][4][1109][nb 39]\\n\\nThe basis of the East German selection and screening system in competitive sports would eventually consist of special training centers (TZ).[1113][1114][nb 40] SV Dynamo would operate numerous training centers across the whole of East Germany. The training centers were either assigned to BFC Dynamo or SG Dynamo Dresden, depending on catchment area. Training in these training centers were better than elsewhere. The work in the training centers was supervised and directed by BFC Dynamo. The best talents from the individual training centers were then brought together and selected in a multi-day screening session.[69] BFC Dynamo would come to benefit from a nationwide scouting network, which included the partnership with Bezirk Cottbus and 33 training centers (TZ) of SV Dynamo.[1118][1119][68] In total, BFC Dynamo had access to 38 training centers (TZ) across East Germany for the recruitment of talents. As a comparison, Union Berlin had only access to six training centers (TZ), all of which were located in the Berlin area.[70]\\n\\nA number of football clubs became specially promoted focus clubs in the 1970 DFV Football Resolution.[60][999] The focus clubs would receive additional financial support from the DTSB and other advantages.[998][996] In the 1976 DFV Football Resolution, focus clubs were also allowed delegate youth players from other football clubs.[1001] BFC Dynamo became the focus club in East Berlin. As a focus club, BFC Dynamo had the right to delegate 12 students to its affiliated Children and Youth Sports Schools (KJS) every year.[1109][1002] Non-focus football clubs only had the right to delegate six students to their affiliated Children and Youth Sports School (KJS) every year.[1002] The elite Children and Youth Sports School (KJS) \\\"Werner Seelenbinder\\\" provided boarding and schooling for talented players in the Sportforum.[1120][1121][1107] The Children and Youth Sports School (KJS) \\\"Werner Seelenbinder\\\" was affiliated to sports club SC Dynamo Berlin.[1122]\\n\\nThe success of BFC Dynamo during the East German era was based on the club\'s extensive youth work.[1123][1124][105][201] In 1975, there were as many as five national team players in the East Germany junior national football team among the club\'s youth players from the class of 1957.[98]1 Only a fifth of the players who won the ten East German championships with BFC Dynamo were older than 18 years when they joined the club.[990] The youth academy produced stars such as Lutz Eigendorf, Falko Götz and Andreas Thom.[1120][1016][1102][752] Most of the top performers of BFC Dynamo in the 1980s came through the club\'s own youth teams, including Frank Terletzki, Hans-Jürgen Riediger, Norbert Trieloff, Bodo Rudwaleit, Ralf Sträßer, Artur Ullrich, Rainer Ernst, Bernd Schulz, Christian Backs, Frank Rohde, Falko Götz, Jan Voß, Andreas Thom, Jörg Fügner, Hendrik Herzog and Marco Köller.[1125][1126][1127] Several former players of SC Dynamo Berlin and BFC Dynamo became youth trainers in the club after ending their playing careers, such as Herbert Schoen, Hermann Bley, Günter Schröter, Martin Skaba, Peter Rohde, Werner Voigt, Hartmut Pelka and Hans-Jürgen Riediger.[1128][1129][1125][1130][1131]\\n\\nNumerous players from East Germany joined West German clubs at the end of East Germany. Many came from BFC Dynamo. More than 110 players who had been trained in East Germany, primarily in a Children and Youth Sports School (KJS), would go on to play for West German or West Berlin clubs in the Bundesliga after the end of East Germany. German author Michael Peter has created a database for all players who had been trained in East Germany and who played for West German or West Berlin football clubs after 1990. For players born before 1976, BFC Dynamo was the biggest contributor. 98 players, born before 1976, came from the ten designated football clubs and SG Dynamo Dresden. 18 of these, came from BFC Dynamo.[1108]\\n\\nHonours\\nNext Generation Oberliga (German: Nachwuchsoberliga) (de)[a]\\nWinners: 1981, 1991[b]\\nRunners-up (6): 1979, 1983\\nEast German Junior Championship (de)[c]\\nWinners: (5) 1960,[d] 1978, 1979, 1987, 1991\\nRunners-up (6): 1967, 1974, 1976, 1977, 1988, 1989\\nEast German Youth Championship (Youth FDJ-Pokal) (de)[e]\\nWinners: (4) 1967, 1972, 1975, 1987\\nRunners-up: 1983, 1989\\nEast German Junior Cup (Junge Welt-Pokal) (de)[c]\\nWinners: (5) 1966, 1967, 1987, 1989, 1990[b] (record)\\nEast German Youth Cup (Youth FDGB-Pokal)[e]\\nWinners: (5) 1965,[d] 1968, 1971, 1972, 1976 (record)\\n Corresponds to U21 level. The league existed from 1976 to 1983 and 1989 to 1991. The reserve teams of the 14 DDR-Oberliga clubs were no longer allowed to participate in the DDR-Liga after the 1975-76 season. The Junior Oberliga (de) was also disbanded after the season. The Next Generation Oberliga was introduced instead. Youth teams of the 14 DDR-Oberliga clubs were all were eligible to start in the 1976-77 Next Generation Oberliga. Next Generation Oberliga was disbanded after the 1982-83 season. All teams were instead assigned to the third tier Bezirksliga. BFC Dynamo participted in the 1983-84 Bezirksliga Berlin with reseve team BFC Dynamo II. BFC Dynamo II won the 1983-84 Bezirksliga Berlin and qualified for the 1984-85 DDR-Liga A.\\n Won as FC Berlin.\\n Corresponds to U19 level.\\n Won by SC Dynamo Berlin.\\n Corresponds to U17 level.\\nExplanatory notes\\n This was not the first or last relocation or transfer of entire football teams in East Germany at the time. Sports association SV Deutsche Volkpolizei relocated its three second-tier teams SV Deutsche Volkspolizei Potsdam, SV Deutsche Volkspolizei Weimar and SV Deutsche Volkspolizei Schwerin to sports communities in larger cities during the summer of 1952. SV Deutsche Volkspolizei Potsdam was relocated to Berlin, SV Deutsche Volkspolizei Weimar to Erfurt and SV Deutsche Volkspolizei Schwerin to Rostock.[6]The team of SV Vorwärts der KVP Leipzig was relocated to East Berlin in 1953. The team continued the 1953-54 DDR-Oberliga as SV Vorwärts der KVP Berlin. SV Vorwärts der KVP Berlin then became ASK Vorwärts Berlin, which later became FC Vorwärts Berlin.[7][4] The relatively successful team of BSG Empor Lauter and its place in the DDR-Oberliga was transferred to sports club SC Empor Rostock in 1954. The football department of SC Empor Rostock later became F.C. Hansa Rostock.[8] The team of BSG Turbine Halle and its place in the DDR-Oberliga was transferred to sports club SC Chemie Halle-Leuna in 1954.[9] The football department of SC Chemie Halle-Leuna later became Hallescher FC Chemie.\\n SG Dynamo Dresden itself had a background that involved political interference and player delegations. SG Dynamo Dresden was previously known as SV Deutsche Volkspolizei Dresden. When SG Friedrichstadt was dissolved by East German sports authorities after the 1949–50 DDR-Oberliga, the playing right in the DDR-Oberliga was transferred to SV Deutsche Volkspolizei Dresden.[10][8][11] SV Deutsche Volkspolizei Dresden had previously played in the lower-tier Stadtliga Dresden and was thus able to enter the DDR-Oberliga without having to progress through divisions.[12][13] In order to keep the place in the DDR-Oberliga, the team of SV Deutsche Volkspolizei Dresden would be reinforced with players from Volkspolizei teams all over the country.[14] The head of the Volkspolizei Kurt Fischer ordered that best football players in the sports communities of the Volkspolizei around East Germany should be concentrated in the now first-tier SV Deutsche Volkspolizei Dresden.[15] The 40 best players of the various Volkspolizei teams in East Germany were then brought together for a training session in Forst in July 1950. Coaches Fritz Sack and Paul Döring then picked out 17 players from 11 different cities who were delegated to Dresden to form the team.[16][11] SV Deutsche Volkspolizei Potsdam lost its five best players and was severaly weakened.[13][17]\\n However, newspaper Neues Deutschland reported an attendance number of 60,000 spectators.[20]\\n BFC Dynamo played friendly matches against Pogoń Szczecin in 1966, 1969, 1973, two times in 1975, 1977, two times in 1978, 1980, 1984, 1985, 1986 and 1987.[43]\\n SV Dynamo would eventually operate numerous training centers (TZ) across East Germany. The training centers were divided between BFC Dynamo and SG Dynamo Dresden depending on catchment area.[69]\\n German author Steffen Karas also claims in his book \\\"66 Jahre BFC Dynamo - Auswärts mit \'nem Bus\\\" that BFC Dynamo actually only scored nine match-deciding goals in the 86th minute or later, in the 218 matches it won or drew during its ten championship years. Only one of those goals came from a penalty. That penalty was the controversial penalty against 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig in the 1985-86 DDR-Oberliga on 22 March 1986, which was later proven to be correct.[205]\\n Karin Halsch was known as Karin Seidel-Kalmutzki at the time.[339]\\n Sources vary on the history of the stadium. A few sources state that the stadium was constructed in 1954 and then refurbished in 1973.[685][693] A centrally located football stadium is depicted in the early plans for the Dynamo-Sportforum by architects Walter Schmidt and Heinz Scharlipp.[694] Other sources suggest that the stadium was completed in its current form in 1970.[695][688][696]\\n The capacity was 12,000 at the beginning of the 1966–67 season and 14,000 at the beginning of the 1968–69 season.[706][707]\\n The skinhead movement in East Germany grew out of the punk subculture, and was characterized as an aggressive form of protest.[777][778] It was radicalized in the middle of the 1980s, by a hybrid of ultranationalism, xenophobia and anti-communism.[778] East Berlin was the epicenter of the East German skinhead movement, with BFC Dynamo and 1. FC Union Berlin as its two football magnets.[778][779] The Stasi concluded that about 30-40 skinheads were associated to the two clubs in December 1985. Many were attached to fan cub Anale Berlin at BFC Dynamo.[778] Anale Berlin became infamous for its violence capital and glorification of fascism.[778][779] There were around 300–400 skinheads in East Berlin in December 1987.[780][717] Many were fans of BFC Dynamo.[717] Reports noted a group of roughly 100 skinheads that regularly attended the away matches of BFC Dynamo in 1988.[781] And the Stasi estimated that there were about 30 skinheads among the followers of 1. FC Union Berlin in July 1988.[4][781] Despite the fierce rivalry between BFC Dynamo and 1. FC Union Berlin, there were contacts between skinheads of the two clubs.[32] Far-right skinheads were attached to fan clubs Borussen and Die Löwen at 1. FC Union Berlin.[772][782]\\n However, hooligans of BFC Dynamo and skinheads allegedly attached to the hooligan scene of BFC Dynamo were also involved in serious incidents associated with racism and right wing-extremism in the 1980s. Hooligans of BFC Dynamo attacked 26 Cuban guest workers on train D 1056 towards Berlin-Lichtenberg, while returning from a match in Halle on 12 May 1984.[788][789] The hooligans had allegedly shouted racist slogans and sung the Deutschlandlied. At least nine Cubans were injured.[790] A number of skinheads allegedly attached to the hooligan scene of BFC Dynamo were also among those convicted for the much-publicized attack on a punk concert in the Zionskirche church in East Berlin on 17 October 1987.[178][137] However, incidents associated to racism and right-wing extremism in East German football were not isolated to BFC Dynamo and authorities also recorded the use of racists slogans, such as \\\"Jewish pigs!\\\", by supporters of several other teams at the time, including SG Dynamo Dresden and 1. FC Union Berlin.[791][792][793]\\n Several sources claim that a group of 500 hooligans of BFC Dynamo attacked a gas station, looted shops and attacked the Volkspolizei in Jena in November 1989.[32][799][459][788][798] One source specifically claims that the incidents occurred in connection to an away match in the DDR-Oberliga.[799] However, the sources do not specify any exact date or any details regarding which match the incidents occur in connection with. FC Berlin played away against FC Carl Zeiss Jena in the 18th matchday of the 1989-90 DDR-Oberliga on 8 April 1990.\\n Hooligans in Magdeburg attacked Soviet soldiers on 29 August 1990. One officer fired a warning shot.[803] The police fired warning shots during violent riots after the friendly match between 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig and FC Bayern Munich on 6 September 1990.[803][813][815] The match between FC Sachsen Leipzig and FC Carl Zeiss Jena in the 1990-91 NOFV-Oberliga on 29 September 1990 was abandoned shortly before the end due to violent riots in the stadium.[813][814]\\n However, the high number of supporters of FC Berlin at the scene claimed by the police has been disputed.[820] The number of supporters of FC Berlin on the scene varies between different sources. The police initially stated that they had faced up to 500 hooligans.[817][824] However, an eyewitness stated that the group that arrived at the S-Bahn station and marched towards the stadium rather consisted of only 150 supporters. This group was supposedly met by around 50 police officers outside the stadium.[820] Neues Deutschland reported that the number of rioters outside the stadium \\\"grew to around 400 to 500 hooligans\\\".[819] A common figure is that 400 supporters of FC Berlin arrived at the S-Bahn station after kick-off.[823][802][825][264] A supporter of FC Berlin has said in Zeit that there were almost 500 supporters of FC Berlin outside the stadium.[265]\\n Another legend tells that Erich Mielke made a remark about bringing the title to Berlin after the fractious encounter between Dynamo Dresden and BFC Dynamo on 2 December 1978, when he allegedly walked into the locker room of Dynamo Dresden and told the players that \\\"You must understand, the capital city needs a champion!\\\".[923] However, according to another version, he instead made this remark when the players of Dynamo Dresden celebrated their title in 1978 and he allegedly ghosted into their locker room to inform them that BFC Dynamo will be champions next year.[924] And according to yet another version, this happened instead after BFC Dynamo had won its second title in 1980, when Erich Mielke allegedly told the players of Dynamo Dresden that \\\"One must understand, the capital city needs a champion.\\\"[178] Dynamo Dresden was one point ahead of BFC Dynamo before the last match day of the 1979-80 DDR-Oberliga. BFC Dynamo met Dynamo Dresden home in the last matchday on 10 May 1980. BFC Dynamo won the match 1-0 and captured the league title. Dynamo Dresden player Udo Schmuck remembers how Mielke came into the locker room of Dynamo Dresden after the match with a gold medal around his neck. He allegedly said: \\\"It doesn\'t matter. The main thing is that Dynamo is champion!\\\".[925] Mielke is also said to have told Dynamo Dresden player Hans-Jürgen Dörner at the same occasion; \\\"Comrade Dörner, it is clear to all of you that the title belongs in the capital, now it\'s the turn of the BFC.\\\"[926]\\n Former SG Dynamo Dresden coach Klaus Sammer claimed in an interview with Berliner Zeitung in 2003 that with \\\"a few exceptions\\\", SG Dynamo Dresden was only able to fall back on the Bezirk Dresden as catchment area.[929] However, Bezirk Dresden was one of the most populous regional districts in East Germany. East German sports journalist Horst Friedemann claims that the SV Dynamo sports communities (SG) of Eisleben and Halle/Neustadt also belonged to the catchment area of SG Dynamo Dresden. They were located under the \\\"southern line\\\", where Dresden had access.[930] SG Dynamo Dresden also had access to training centers (TZ) of SV Dynamo. SV Dynamo operated numerous training centers across East Germany. The training centers were either assigned to BFC Dynamo or SG Dynamo Dresden, depending on catchment area.[931] In total, SG Dynamo Dresden had 35 partner associations (German: Partnervereine), including training centers (TZ). Their task was mainly to scout the best players and then send them to Dresden.[932] German sports historian Hanns Leske has categorized SG Dynamo Dresden as the third most privileged football club or sports community in East German football, behind FC Vorwärts Berlin and BFC Dynamo.[933]\\n Supporters of 1. FC Union Berlin used the same provocation at away matches in Saxony, despite their cultivation of their club\'s underdog image. A supporter of 1. FC Union Berlin has testified that they brought Cuban organges and rotten bananas to an away match against FC Karl-Marx-Stadt, fully aware that these fruits were symbols of their privileges as East Berliners.[962]\\n BFC Dynamo was officially a club of the Ministry of the Interior.[973] The official sponsor (German: Träger) of the club was the Volkspolizei.[36] The official sponsor of Union Berlin was the state-owned combine VVB Hochspannungsgeräte und Kabel.[974]\\n The football clubs had been assigned one or two districts in East Germany as catchment areas at their founding. 1. FC Union Berlin had been assigned Bezirk Potsdam and one third of all training centers (TZ) in East Berlin. BFC Dynamo had been assigned Bezirk Cottbus and one third of training centers (TZ) in East Berlin. BFC Dynamo now had access to Bezirk Cottbus and two thirds of all training centers (TZ) in East Berlin. 1. FC Union Berlin on the other hand had to make do with its training centers (TZ) in East Berlin.[35][970]\\n FC Vorwärts Berlin was initially a focus club in East Berlin.[1000] The only major club in East Berlin that was never appointed as focus club was 1. FC Union Berlin.[60] FC Vorwärts Berlin continued to be part of the group of focus clubs after its relocation to Frankfurt an der Oder.[1000]\\n Football clubs were given performance assignments from the DTSB that had to be fulfilled. The clubs then had to report on the fulfillment in two-year analyzes. Union Berlin had the objective in 1977-78 of producing four players who could be delegated to the focus club BFC Dynamo. Union Berlin explained that its downward trend in the youth area was due to the fact that the club had to delegate its two best players to the focus club every year and that the club could only rely on four districts in East Berlin for further selection.[978]\\n The club management of 1. FC Union Berlin seriously considered moving all matches to Stadion der Weltjugend after a stormy encounter with BSG Wismut Aue in 1976.[1007]\\n Manfred Kirste was the first president and is the longest serving president. He served as president from 15 January 1966 to 30 August 1988.\\n Served as president until 19 Februari 1990.[1064]\\n Became acting president after the dismissal of Herbert Krafft on 19 February 1990. Bogs served as acting president until 27 May 1990.[1064]\\n Dr. Klaus Janz served as president until 15 October 1990.[1065] He asked to be relieved from the office due to professional stress as a lawyer. He continued as vice president.[1066]\\n Dr. Wolfgang Hösrich became president on 15 October 1990. He had a background as a club doctor for SC Dynamo Berlin and BFC Dynamo. Hösrich had previously served as vice president.[1067][1066] The presidium under Dr. Wolfgang Hösrich was replaced by a new presidium under Eberhard Landmann on 20 May 1994.[1068][1069][1070]\\n Eberhard Landmann became president on 20 May 1994.[1071] Landmann was a former insurance salesman. He only served as president for nine months.[1068][1069][1072]\\n Klaus Bittroff was elected as the new president on 10 February 1995 with the votes 73-11. Volkmar Wanski was elected as one of two vice presidents alongside re-elected Lutz Hoff.[1073][1072][1071] Bittroff had previously served as president of Wacker 04 Berlin from 1984 to 1991.[1071]\\n Became new president after the resignation of Klaus Bittroff on 14 September 1995.[287] Wanski resigned on 29 June 2000.[335][1072][1074]\\n Sports director Hans Reker was appointed acting president by the Economic council following the resignation of Volkmar Wanski on 29 June 2000.[335][1074] Karin Halsch took office as new president on 27 September 2000.[339]\\n Karin Halsch was known as Karin Seidel-Kalmutzki during the era. Served from 27 September 2000 to 25 June 2001.[339][1075]\\n Sports director Hans Reker served as acting president following the resignation of Karin Halsch on 25 June 2001.[1075][356] Hans Reker held the position of vice president in the presidium of Karin Halsch.[1076][346] He resigned together with the entire presidium on 30 October 2001.[376] An emergency board formed by André Sommer, Rayk Bernt and press spokesman Holger Zimmermann took office. The emergency board was meant to serve until the extraordinary general meeting on 26 November 2001.[376][387]\\n An emergency board formed by André Sommer, Rayk Bernt and press spokesman Holger Zimmermann took office on 1 November 2001. No new president was appointed for the transitional board.[376][387] Zimmerman soon resigned on 23 November 2001.[653] A new presidium was due to be elected on the extraordinary general meeting on 26 November 2001. However, the meeting agenda was changed with the votes 87 to 59 at the insistence of the emergency board. The meeting was converted into an information event and new elections were postponed.[653][1077] Club members collected signatures for the election of a new presidium. But the signatures would be ignored by Sommer and Bernt.[388] The Sommer and Bernt presidium was finally overthrown by supporters and the former coach of the women\'s team Volkmar Lucius after an application to the Charlottenburg district court.[388][401] The Charlottenburg district court appointed Lucius as emergency board member.[388] A new presidium was elected on the extraordinary general meeting on 31 May 2002.[1078]\\n Elected on an extraordinary general meeting on 31 May 2002.[1078]\\n Mario Weinkauf was elected president on 18 June 2004.[426] He resigned on a meeting with the presidium on 22 June 2007. He was then dismissed in a vote of no-confidence on an extra-ordinary general meeting on 23 June 2007. Mario Weinkauf was succeeded by Volkmar Wanski as interim president. Volkmar Wanski had been co-opted into the presidium and elected as the provisional successor to Mario Weinkauf on the meeting with the presidium on 22 June 2007. However the interim presidency of Volkmar Wanski was controversial. It was put into question whether his election was compliant with club statutes. Volkmar Wanski resigned after only six days.[1079][1080][1081]\\n Frank Bertron was launched as interim president by the Economic Council under Peter Meyer.[487][1081] He was presented as new president on 28 June 2007.[1081]\\n Norbert Uhlig is the second longest serving president after Manfred Kirste. Norbert Uhlig has been president since 11 October 2008.[1082]\\n German sports historian Hanns Leske writes that BFC Dynamo was able to recruit young players from the youth departments of all sports communities (SG) of SV Dynamo in East Germany, except those in Bezirk Dresden.[1110] German author Anne Hahn writes that the training centers (TZ) of SV Dynamo across East Germany were divided between BFC Dynamo and SG Dynamo Dresden. She writes that the catchment area of BFC Dynamo included the SV Dynamo sports communities (SG) of Rostock-Mitte, Neustrelitz, Fürstenwalde, Schwerin and Berlin. The best talents were brought together in these training centers and then selected in a central, multi-day screening courses.[931] Also Horst Friedemann claims that the catchment area of BFC Dynamo included the SV Dynamo sports communities (SG) of Rostock-Mitte, Neustrelitz, Fürstenwalde and Schwerin. According to Friedemann, the SV Dynamo sports communities (SG) of Eisleben and Halle/Neustadt instead belonged to the catchment area of SG Dynamo Dresden. That was the \\\"southern line\\\", where Dresden had access.[1111][1112]\\n The training centers (TZ) were the first preparatory stage for the support of children found suitable for sports. Training in training centers usually started at the age of 10.[1115] The training course usually lasted for three to four years.[1115] From the training centers, the best young talents could then be delegated to a Children and Youth Sports School (KJS) and a Sports club (SC) or a Football club (FC).[1116][1113][1117]\\nReferences\\nTemplate:Reflist\\n\\nFurther reading\\nTemplate:Cite news\\nBertram, Marco (2015).

V., commonly abbreviated to BFC Dynamo (German pronunciation: [beːʔɛfˌt͡seː dyˈnaːmo] (listen)) or BFC (German pronunciation: [beːʔɛfˈt͡seː] (listen)), alternatively sometimes called Dynamo Berlin, is a German football club based in the locality of Alt-Hohenschönhausen of the borough of Lichtenberg of Berlin. BFC Dynamo was founded in 1966 from the football department of SC Dynamo Berlin and became one of the most successful clubs in East German football. The club is the record champion of East Germany with ten consecutive league championships from 1979 through 1988. BFC Dynamo competes in the fourth tier Regionalliga Nordost. The club enjoys a cross-city rivalry with 1. FC Union Berlin and a historical rivalry with SG Dynamo Dresden. The rivalry with Union Berlin is part of the Berlin derby.\n\nHistory\nBackgrund, founding and rise (1954–1978)\nMain article: History of Berliner FC Dynamo (1954–1978)\nBackground: SC Dynamo Berlin (1954–1966)\nBFC Dynamo started as a football department of sports club SC Dynamo Berlin. SC Dynamo Berlin was founded on 1 October 1954 as one of the new elite sports clubs in East Germany.[2] The sports club was affiliated to sport association SV Dynamo. In order to establish a competitive side in Berlin, the team of SG Dynamo Dresden and its place in the DDR-Oberliga was transferred to the new sports club SC Dynamo Berlin. The relocation was designed to give the capital a team that would rival teams from West Berlin such as Hertha BSC, which were still popular in East Berlin.[3][4][5][nb 1][nb 2]\n\n\nGünter Schröter (left), Horst Kohle of ASK Vorwärts Berlin (centre) and Martin Skaba (right) during a match between Vorwärts Berlin and Dynamo Berlin at the Walther-Ulbricht-Stadion on 18 October 1959\nThe team played its first match as SC Dynamo Berlin against BSG Rotation Babelsberg in the 1954-55 DDR-Oberliga on 21 November 1954. Among the players delegated from SG Dynamo Dresden were Johannes Matzen, Herbert Schoen and Günter Schröter. SC Dynamo Berlin finished its first season in the DDR-Oberliga in seventh place. The team was relatively successful in the 1955 DDR-Oberliga, but suffered relegation to the second tier DDR-Liga after the 1956 DDR-Oberliga. SC Dynamo Berlin played a friendly match against Polish side Górniczy KS Szombierki Bytom in front of 80,000 spectators at the Walter-Ulricht-Stadion on 9 May 1957.[18][19] The attendance number is allegedly the highest in the history of the club.[19][nb 3] SC Dynamo Berlin eventually finished the 1957 DDR-Liga in first place immediately returned to the DDR-Oberliga.\n\nGünter Schröter and Herbert Maschke would remain central players to the team into early the 1960s. But most other players of the former SG Dynamo Dresden team were no longer active in the team by the late 1950s.[21] Herbert Schoen had played his last competitive matches for the team during the 1957 season and Johannes Matzen had suffered a serious injury during the 1958 season and consequently had to end his playing career.[22] The team was now instead shaped by a new generation of players, including Martin Skaba, Werner Heine, Waldemar Mühlbächer, Hermann Bley and Konrad Dorner (de).[23]\n\n\nThe team of SC Dynamo Berlin after winning the 1959 FDGB-Pokal, at the Bruno-Plache-Stadion in Leipzig on 13 December 1959\nSC Dynamo Berlin had difficulties establishing itself in football in East Berlin.[17] The team rarely drawing crowds larger than 5,000 spectators at the Walter-Ulbricht-Stadion. SC Dynamo Berlin finally won its first trophy in the 1959 FDGB-Pokal. However, the team would not be allowed to participate in the 1960-61 European Cup Winners\' Cup. The East German Football Association (DFV) found local rival and league runner-up ASK Vorwärts Berlin to be a more suitable representative of East Germany in the competition.[24]\n\nSC Dynamo Berlin also had some success in the first seasons of the 1960s. The team fished the 1960 DDR-Oberliga as runner-up. SC Dynamo Berlin was a top team also in the 1961-62 DDR-Oberliga. The team participated in the 1961–62 International Football Cup during the summer of 1961. SC Dynamo Berlin was successful in 1961-62 FDGB-Pokal. The team was only defeated 1-3 by SC Chemie Halle in the final.[25] However, SC Dynamo Berlin still found itself overshadowed in the capital by the army-sponsored ASK Vorwärts Berlin.[26] The team of SC Dynamo Berlin during the 1960s would eventually prove relatively weak.[27] SC Dynamo Berlin had become a lower table side by the end of the 1962–63 Oberliga.[21]\n\nEast German football was reformed in 1965–66, when the football departments of ten sports clubs (SC) were made independent from their sports clubs to form ten dedicated football clubs. The new designated football clubs (FC) would form the elite of East German football. As part of the reorganization, the football section of SC Dynamo Berlin was separated from the sports club and reorganized as football club BFC Dynamo.[28][29][4][30] The football department of sports community SG Dynamo Hohenschönhausen was also disbanded after the 1965–66 season. The players of SG Dynamo Hochenschönhausen joined the reserve team BFC Dynamo II and BFC Dynamo II took over the place of SG Dynamo Hohenschönhausen in the 1966-67 Bezirksliga Berlin.\n\nFounding and second relegation (1966–1967)\nBFC Dynamo was founded on 15 January 1966.[31] The new club was presented by the President of SV Dynamo Erich Mielke at a ceremony in the Dynamo-Sporthalle in Hohenschönhausen in East Berlin.[32] The first presidium included the Head of the Volkspolizei in East Berlin Horst Ende, the Intendant of the Metropol theatre Hans Pitra, former DDR-Oberliga player Johannes Matzen and the Editor-in-chief of the East German football weekly Die Neue Fußballwoche (FuWo) (de) Klaus Schlegel.[33] Manfred Kirste was elected club president and Mielke was elected honorary president.[32][31] Kirste came from Berlin and was a certified sports teacher.[34]\n\n\nThe match between BFC Dynamo and FC Vorwärts Berlin in the DDR-Oberliga at the Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum on 13 August 1966\nThe new designated football clubs (FC) were formed as centers of excellence in East German football, with the right to draw on talents within designated geographical and administrative areas.[4][29] BFC Dynamo was initiallly assigned Bezirk Cottbus and one third of East Berlin as catchment area.[35] BFC Dynamo was officially a club of the Ministry of the Interior, and the club\'s official sponsor was the Volkspolizei.[36][37] However, the honorary chairman Mielke was the head of the Stasi and most of the club\'s sponsoring members would eventually be made up of Stasi employees. BFC Dynamo would come to receive personal, organizational and financial support from the Stasi.[37][38] Research by the Stasi Records Agency has shown that 31 employees of the Ministry of the Interior and ten employees of the Stasi would eventually be involved in the club.[39]\n\nSC Dynamo Berlin had been in first place in the 1965-66 DDR-Oberliga after the eighth matchday.[40] BFC Dynamo were still in a good fourth place after a 2–0 win over BSG Chemie Leipzig on the 23rd matchday on 16 April 1966. However, the team then lost its last three matches in the league, against F.C. Hansa Rostock, SG Dynamo Dresden and FC Rot-Weiß Erfurt, and finished the season in ninth place.[41]\n\nHungarian Bela Volentik was new coach for the 1966–67 season. The team played a friendly match against Polish side Pogoń Szczecin on 10 September 1966. The match would be one of many in a long series of friendly maches against Pogoń Szczecin during the East German era.[42][nb 4] The team struggled in the 1966-67 DDR-Oberliga. BFC Dynamo faced local rivals 1. FC Union Berlin away on the 22nd matchday on 26 April 1967. BFC Dynamo was in 13th place in the league and threatened with relegation.[44][45] Supporters of 1. FC Union Berlin mocked the team with a banner saying \"We greet the relegated\". 1. FC Union Berlin won the match 3-0 and BFC Dynamo was now practically relegated.[45] The match is seen as the starting point for the feud between the two clubs.[45] BFC Dynamo eventually finished the 1966-67 DDR-Oberliga in 13th place and was again relegated to the DDR-Liga. Long-time player Waldemar Mühlbächer retired from his playing career after the season.[46] Mühlbächer had joined SC Dynamo Berlin in 1956 and had played 11 seasons for the team.[47]\n\nRejuvenation and first UEFA competition (1967–1972)\nFormer SC Dynamo Berlin forward Karl Schäffner returned as coach for the 1967–68 season.[48] BFC Dynamo dominated the 1967-68 DDR-Liga Nord. The team was undefeated during the second half of the league season and immediately won promotion back to the DDR-Oberliga.[49] Forward Peter Lyszczan became tied league top goalscorer in the 1967-68 DDR-Liga Nord with 19 goals.[50] Martin Skaba and Hermann Bley retired after the 1967–68 season and Konrad Dorner was transferred to the reserve team BFC Dynamo II.[51] The three had joined SC Dynamo Berlin between 1956 and 1958. Skaba had played in a total of 343 matches for the team.[52]\n\nBFC Dynamo began a rejuvenation of the team during the 1967–68 season.[51] Among the players from the youth department who got to play matches in the 1967-68 DDR-Liga Nord were Harald Schütze (de), Norbert Johannsen and Werner Voigt.[53] BFC Dynamo fielded a young team in the 1968–69 season. The average age of the team was 23 years at the start of the season.[54] Harald Schütze was now a regular player in the team.[51] BFC Dynamo got off to a difficult start on its return to the DDR-Oberliga. Hans Geitel took over as coach for the second half of the season. Geitel had previously worked in the youth academy of BFC Dynamo.[55] The team finished the 1968-69 DDR-Oberliga in tenth place.\n\nBFC Dynamo recruited young forward Ralf Schulenberg from FC Rot-Weiß Erfurt for the 1969–70 season.[56] Schulenberg was probably compensation for the talented Günter Wolff, who had left BFC Dynamo for FC Rot-Weiß Erfurt after the 1967–68 season.[55] A number of players from the youth departments would also make their debut in the DDR-Oberliga in the following seasons, such as Peter Rohde (de) in 1969, Frank Terletzki in 1969 and Bernd Brillat in 1970. BFC Dynamo reached the final of the 1970-71 FDGB-Pokal. The team lost the final 1–2 in overtime to SG Dynamo Dresden, but qualified for the next season\'s UEFA Cup Winners\' Cup as runner-up.[57] This time, the team would also be allowed to participate in the competition, unlike in 1960. BFC Dynamo was thus finally ready for its first participation in an UEFA competition.[58]\n\nA number of football clubs became specially promoted focus clubs (German: Schwerpunktclubs) in the 1970 DFV Football Resolution (German: DFV-Fußballbeschluss).[59][60] BFC Dynamo and FC Vorwärts Berlin became focus clubs in East Berlin.[60][61] The football landscape in East Berlin would then change dramatically ahead of the 1971–72 season, when the Ministry of Defense decided to relocate FC Vortwärts Berlin to Frankfurt an der Oder.[62][63] BFC Dynamo and 1. FC Union Berlin were from now on the only major football clubs in East Berlin.[64] BFC Dynamo would be allowed to take over the catchment area in East Berlin that had previously belonged to FC Vorwärts Berlin.[65][64] The team would also have the opportunity to play more matches at the larger and more centrally located Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark in Prenzlauer Berg, which led to increased interest in the club and growing attendance numbers.[66]\n\nBFC Dynamo stood out among other teams within SV Dynamo. BFC Dynamo was located at the frontline of the Cold War. It was also a representative of the East German capital. This meant that the club had to be well equipped.[67] BFC Dynamo would eventually get access to a nationwide scouting network, including numerous training centers (German: Trainingszentrum) (TZ) of SV Dynamo across East Germany.[68][nb 5] BFC Dynamo would eventually be able to recruit young talented players from 38 training centers (TZ) across East Germany. By comparison, 1. FC Union Berlin only had access to 6 training centers (TZ), all of which were located in the Berlin area.[70]\n\nThe team was joined by forward Wolf-Rüdiger Netz from SG Dynamo Schwerin for the 1971–72 season. Among the central players in the team in the 1971–72 season were Werner Lihsa, Harald Schütze, Frank Terletzki, Dieter Stumpf, Norbert Johannsen, Peter Rohde, Wilfried Trümpler, Joachen Carow, Wolf-Rüdiger Netz and Ralf Schulenberg.[71] BFC Dynamo had success in the 1971–72 UEFA Cup Winners\' Cup. The team eliminated Cardiff City F.C. in the first round and then K Beerschot VA in the second round. BFC Dynamo would now also show its strength in the DDR-Oberliga. The team was unbeaten in the first six league matches after the winter break, including wins against top teams 1. FC Magdeburg and SG Dynamo Dresden.[72] The team eliminated Åtvidabergs FF in the quarter-finals of the 1971–72 UEFA Cup Winners\' Cup and advanced to the semi-finals.[73] BFC Dynamo thus became the first team from Berlin to reach the semi-finals in one of the two most prestigious UEFA competitions (the European Cup and the European Cup Winners\' Cup). BFC Dynamo was eventually eliminated by Dynamo Moscow in the semi-finals after a penalty shoot-out at the Druzhba Stadium in Lviv in the return leg on 20 April 1972.[74] The team finished the 1971-72 DDR-Oberliga as runner-up.\n\nRise in the DDR-Oberliga (1972–1978)\nBFC Dynamo was qualified for the 1972-73 UEFA Cup. The team eliminated Angers SCO and Levski Sofia in the first two rounds. BFC Dynamo was then set to play Liverpool F.C. in the third round. The first leg ended 0–0 in front of 20,000 spectators at the Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum on 29 November 1972.[75] The team was eventually eliminated after a 1–3 defeat at Anfield on 13 December 1972. BFC Dynamo saw a decline in the league and finished 1972-73 DDR-Oberliga in sixth place. The talented 17-year-old forward Hans-Jürgen Riediger from the youth department made his debut for BFC Dynamo in the DDR-Oberliga at the end of the 1972–73 season.[76]\n\n\nThe match between BFC Dynamo and F.C. Hansa Rostock at the Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum on 28 September 1974.\nHarry Nippert became the new coach for the 1973–74 season.[77] Günter Schröter became his assistant.[78] Nippert had once played for SC Dynamo Berlin.[79] He had recently served as assistant to famous SG Dynamo Dresden coach Walter Fritzsch from 1969 to 1973.[80] BFC Dynamo recruited attacking midfielder and national team player Reinhard Lauck from relegated 1. FC Union Berlin for of the 1973–74 season.[78] Numerous players were tried during the season. Not a single player played all 26 league matches during the 1973–74 season.[81] The team finished also the 1973-74 DDR-Oberliga in sixth place. Martin Skaba became the new assistant coach for the 1974–75 season.[82] BFC Dynamo recruited young defender Michael Noack (de) from relegated BSG Energie Cottbus for the season.[82] League results improved and BFC Dynamo finished the 1974-75 DDR-Oberliga in fourth place. Several players from the youth department made their debuts for BFC Dynamo in DDR-Oberliga during the 1974–75 season: Lutz Eigendorf, Roland Jüngling (de) and Norbert Trieloff.[83][84][85]\n\n\nHans-Jürgen Riediger in the match between BFC Dynamo and 1. FC Magdeburg at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark on 6 March 1976.\nBFC Dynamo moved is home matches to the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark for the 1975–76 season.[86] Frank Terletzki became the new team captain for the season.[83] BFC Dynamo had the youngest team in the league in the 1975-76 DDR-Oberliga, with an average age of only 22.5 years.[87][83] BFC Dynamo was now again on the rise in the DDR-Oberliga. The team would eventually establish itself as a top team in the DDR-Oberliga in the mid-1970s. BFC Dynamo recorded several big wins and attendance numbers at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark in the 1975-76 DDR-Oberliga, such as 4–0 against second-placed 1. FC Magdeburg in front of 22,000 spectators on 6 March 1976, 3–0 against FC Carl Zeiss Jena in front of 23,000 spectators on 14 April 1976 and then 6–0 against third-placed 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig in front of 25,000 spectators on 8 May 1976.[88][89][90][91][92] The team finished the 1975-76 DDR-Oberliga as runner-up. The young team under Nippert achieved a goal difference of 67–24 in the 1975-76 DDR-Oberliga.[17]\n\nBFC Dynamo recruited young defender Rainer Troppa from relegated BSG Energie Cottbus for the 1976–77 season.[93] The team lost 0–1 to local rivals 1. FC Union Berlin in the opening match of the 1976-77 DDR-Oberliga in front of 45,000 spectators at the Stadion der Weltjugend on 4 September 1976.[94][95] BFC Dynamo was qualified for the 1976–77 UEFA Cup. The team was eliminated in the first round by Shakhtar Donetsk. Goalkeeper Bodo Rudwaleit and forward Ralf Sträßer from the youth department made their debuts for BFC Dynamo in the DDR-Oberliga during the first half of the 1976–77 season.[96][97] The return match against 1.

Their younger brother Frank Rohde, a youth player at BFC Dynamo, was one of the 28,000 spectators at the Stadion der Weltjugend. BFC Dynamo lost also the return match 0–1. However, the loss in the return match in the 1976-77 DDR-Oberliga would be the last ever defeat against 1. FC Union Berlin in the DDR-Oberliga.[95] BFC Dynamo came back with a 6–0 win over F.C. Hansa Rostock on the following matchday on 26 February 1977. Wolf-Rüdiger Netz scored a legendary hat-trick in the match, with three goals in the 63rd, 64th and 66th match minutes.[98]\n\n30-year-old Jürgen Bogs became the new coach for the 1977–78 season.[99][100][101] Bogs had a background as a youth coach in the club. BFC Dynamo recruited striker Hartmut Pelka from DDR-Liga team BSG Chemie Leipzig for 1977–78 season.[99] Rudwaleit became the new first-choice goalkeeper at the beginning of the season.[102] BFC Dynamo reached the semi-finals of the 1977-78 FDGB-Pokal. The team was eliminated by 1. FC Magdeburg in the two-legged semi-final. 1. FC Magdeburg, with star player Joachim Streich, would eventually go on and win the cup.

The veterans in the team were Frank Terletzki, Reinhard Lauck, Wolf-Rüdiger Netz and Bernd Brillat.[106][107] The young team was coached by 31-year-old Jürgen Bogs.[106] BFC Dynamo under Bogs played an aggressive football that focused on attacking.[108]\n\n\nThe team of BFC Dynamo after winning its first title in the DDR-Oberliga on 26 May 1979. Club President Manfred Kirste is seen standing second from left.\nBFC Dynamo played arch-rival 1. FC Union Berlin in the third machday of the 1978-79 DDR-Oberliga.

BFC Dynamo had a successful start in the 1978-79 DDR-Oberliga and was in first place after the first half of the season.[113] Lutz Eigendorf defected to West Germany in connection with a friendly match in Kaiserslautern on 20 March 1979.[114] His defection was a slap in the face of the East German regime.[115] Eigendorf had been one of the most promising players in East Germany.[116] BFC Dynamo reached the final of the 1978-79 FDGB-Pokal. The team met 1. FC Magdeburg in the final. The match was played in front of 50,000 spectators at the Stadion der Weltjugend on 28 April 1979. 1. FC Magdeburg won the match 1-0 after a goal by Wolfgang Seguin in extra time.[117] BFC Dynamo eventually won its first DDR-Oberliga title after defeating rivals SG Dynamo Dresden 3–1 on the 24th matchday in front of 22,000 spectators at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark on 26 May 1979.[118] The team broke several league records during the 1978–79 season, such as: most number of matches won since the start of a season (10), most number of unbeaten matches since the start of a season (22), most goals scored in one season under the current format (75) and the biggest win in the DDR-Oberliga in the last 30 years (10-0 against BSG Sachsenring Zwickau on the 17th matchday).[119][120]\n\nBFC Dynamo made its debut in the European Cup in the 1979–80 season. The team made it all the way to the quarter-finals of the 1979–80 European Cup, where it faced Nottingham Forest under Brian Clough. The team won the first leg 0–1 away. BFC Dynamo thus became the first German team to defeat an English team in England in the European Cup.[121] The winning goal was scored by Hans-Jürgen Riediger. However, the team lost the return leg 0-2 and was eliminated on goal difference. BFC Dynamo was one point behind leading SG Dynamo Dresden heading into the final matchday of the 1979-80 DDR-Oberliga.[122] The team defeated SG Dynamo Dresden 1–0 in the final matchday in front of 30,000 spectators at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark and won its second consecutive league title. The winning goal was scored by Norbert Trieloff.[123][124]\n\nThe East Germany national football team won silver medal at the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow. BFC Dynamo was represented by five players in the squad: Bodo Rudwaleit, Artur Ullrich, Norbert Trieloff, Frank Terletzki and Wolf-Rüdiger Netz. All five played in the final against Czechoslovakia at the Central Lenin Stadion on 2 August 1980.[125] Joachim Hall (de) became the new assistant coach for the 1980–81 season.[126] Hall had played for SC Dynamo Berlin and BFC Dynamo between 1963 and 1972. Also the 1980-81 DDR-Oberliga was a tight race. BFC Dynamo was in first place heading into the final matchday, with the same number of points as second-placed FC Carl Zeiss Jena.[127] BFC Dynamo defeated FC Carl Zeiss Jena 2–1 in the final match day and won its third consecutive league title.[128] Even more players from the youth department had been integrated into the first team over the last seasons, such as Rainer Ernst in 1979, Bernd Schulz in 1979, Olaf Seier in 1979, Frank Rohde in 1980, Falko Götz in 1980 and Christian Backs in 1981.\n\nBFC Dynamo was drawn against AS Saint-Étienne in the first round of the 1981-82 European Cup. AS Saint-Étienne fielded the French national team captain and future football legend Michel Platini at the time.[129] BFC Dynamo advanced to the second round after double wins against AS Saint-Étienne. The team was eventually eliminated by Aston Villa in the Round of 16. BFC Dynamo played a friendly match against Bundesliga team VfB Stuttgart during the winter break. The match ended 0–0 in front of 25,000 spectators at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark on 15 December 1981.[130][131] BFC Dynamo reached the final of the 1981-82 FDGB-Pokal. The team was in first place in the league and thus had the chance to prepare a Double. BFC Dynamo faced SG Dynamo Dresden in the final. The match was played in front of 48,000 spectators at the Stadion der Weltjugend on 1 May 1982. BFC Dynamo lost the match in a penalty shoot-out.[132] The team eventually secured its fourth consecutive league title in the following week, defeating 1. FC Magdeburg 4–0 on the 23rd matchday of the 1981-82 DDR-Oberliga in front of 18,000 spectators at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark on 8 May 1982.[133] Supporters of BFC Dynamo invaded the pitch of the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark in celebration of the league title. It was the first pitch invasion by the supporters of BFC Dynamo in the DDR-Oberliga.[134]\n\nDominance in the DDR-Oberliga (1982–1986)\n\nHans-Jürgen Riediger and defending Holger Hieronymus of Hamburger SV in the 1982-83 European Cup at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark on 15 September 1982.\nBFC Dynamo was drawn against West German champions Hamburger SV in the first round of the 1982-83 European Cup. The Stasi feated riots, political demonstrations and supporters who might express sympathy for West German stars such as Felix Magath. Only 2,000 tickets were allowed for ordinary fans. The rest was instead allocated to a politically hand-picked audience.[135][136][137] The first leg ended 1–1 in front of 22,000 spectators at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark. Hans-Jürgen Riedier scored the only goal for BFC Dynamo in the match. BFC Dynamo was eventually eliminated after a 2–0 defeat at the Volksparkstadion in the return leg. BFC Dynamo now dominated the DDR-Oberliga. The team went through the entire 1982-83 DDR-Oberliga undefeated. BFC Dynamo was eventually defeated 1-2 by FC Karl-Marx-Stadt on the seventh matchday of the 1983-84 DDR-Oberliga on 1 October 1983. It was the first loss since the 22nd matchday of the 1981-82 DDR-Oberliga. BFC Dynamo had thus been undefeated in 36 matches in the league, which set a new record in the DDR-Oberliga for the longest unbeaten run.[138][139]\n\nBFC Dynamo was drawn against FK Partizan Belgrade in the second round of the 1983-84 European Cup. The team won the first leg 2–0 at home. The team flew to Belgrade with Erich Mielke\'s service aeroplane on 1 November 1983 for the return leg.[140] During a shopping trip in Belgrade the day before the match, players Falko Götz and Dirk Schlegel (de) defected to West Germany.[140][141] The talented 18-year old forward Andreas Thom from the youth department was given the chance to make his international debut in the match as a replacement for Falko Götz. Thom had only played 5 minutes in the DDR-Oberliga before that.[142] Thom made a terrific international debut and would henceforth be a regular player in the team.[141][143][144] The match ended 1-1 and BFC Dynamo advanced to the quarter-finals. BFC Dynamo was drawn against AS Roma in the quarter-finals of the 1983-84 European Cup. The team lost the first leg 0–3 in front of in front of 62,000 spectators at the Stadio Olimpico.[145] BFC Dynamo won the return leg 2–1 in front of 25,000 spectators at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark, but was eliminated on goal difference.[146] AS Roma would go all the way to the final. It was the fourth time in five seasons that BFC Dynamo had been eliminated in the European Cup by an eventual finalist. Three times had BFC Dynamo been eliminated by the team that eventually won the tournament: Nottingham Forrest in the 1979-80 season, Aston Villa in the 1981-82 season and Hamburger SV in the 1982-83 season.\n\nBFC Dynamo capured its sixth consecutive league title on the 25th matchday of the 1983-84 DDR-Oberliga.[147] Rainer Ernst became the best goal scorer in the 1983-48 DDR-Oberliga with 20 goals.[148] Several players from the youth department made their debuts for BFC Dynamo in the DDR-Oberliga during the 1983–84 season, such as Andreas Thom, Thomas Grether, Mario Maek and Eike Küttner.[149] BFC Dynamo reached the final of the 1983-84 FDGB-Pokal. The team once again faced SG Dynamo Dresden in the final. BFC Dynamo lost the final 1–2.[150] Hans-Jürgen Riediger and Michael Noack ended their careers due to prolonged injuries after the season. Wolf-Rüdiger Netz retired and Ralf Sträßer left for 1. FC Union Berlin.[151] Riediger, Noack and Netz had all played around 200 matches each for BFC Dynamo in the DDR-Oberliga.[152][153][154] Riediger and Netz had also scored more than 100 goals each for BFC Dynamo in the DDR-Oberliga.[153][154]\n\n\nThe team of BFC Dynamo celebrating its seventh consecutive DDR-Oberliga title at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark on 1 June 1985.\nBFC Dynamo recruited striker Frank Pastor from relegated HFC Chemie and defender Waldemar Ksienzyk from relegated 1. FC Union Berlin for the 1984–85 season.[151] The team was drawn against Aberdeen FC under Alex Ferguson in the first round of the 1984–85 European Cup.[155] The team lost the first leg 2–1 away.[156][157] BFC Dynamo eventually won the round after dramatic penalty shoot-out at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark in the return leg. Goalkeeper Bodo Rudwaleit saved the last two penalty kicks for Aberdeen FC.[158][159][157] BFC Dynamo was neck-to-neck with SG Dynamo Dresden in the first half of the 1984-85 DDR-Oberliga. BFC Dynamo eventually finished the 1984-85 DDR-Oberliga in first place, six points ahead of SG Dynamo Dresden, and won its seventh consecutive league title. The team had scored a total of 90 goals during the league season, which set a new record for the number of goals in one DDR-Oberliga season.[160] No team would ever score more goals in one season in the DDR-Oberliga. Rainer Ernst was once again the best goal scorer in the league with 24 goals. Frank Pastor was the second best goal scorer in the league with 22 goals.[161] BFC Dynamo reached the final of the FDGB-Pokal for a second consecutive season and once again faced rival SG Dynamo Dresden in the final. BFC Dynamo lost the final of the 1984-85 FDGB-Pokal 2–3.[162]\n\n\nThe match between 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig and BFC Dynamo on 22 March 1986.\nBFC Dynamo was already eliminated in the first round of the 1985-86 European Cup by Austria Wien. The team faced stiff competition from SG Dynamo Dresden during the first half of the 1985-86 DDR-Oberliga. Youg defender Jörg Fügner from the youth departent made his debut for BFC Dynamo in the DDR-Oberliga towards the end of the first half of the season.[163] BFC Dynamo was in first place in the league before the winter break.[164] The team faced fourth-placed 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig on the 18th matchday. 1. FC Lokomotiv Leipzig led the match 1–0 in overtime. BFC Dynamo was then awarded a penalty in the 94th minute.[165] Frank Pastor safely converted the penalty and the match ended in a 1–1 draw.[166] The penalty was highly controversial and would later become known as the \"Shame penalty of Leipzig\".[167] BFC Dynamo also faced 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig in the two-legged semi-finals of the 1985-86 FDGB-Pokal. BFC Dynamo was eliminated on the away goals rule. 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig had scored a total of three goals on penalties in the semi-finals.[168][169] BFC Dynamo managed to secure its eighth consecutive league title on the final matchday of the 1985-86 DDR-Oberliga.[170][171] The team finished just two points ahead of runners-up 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig. Long time-player Frank Terletzki retired from his playing career after the season. Terletzki had played in a total of 489 matches for BFC Dynamo since 1969.[172]\n\nBFC Dynamo had the best material conditions in the league and the best team by far.[173] But controversial refereeing decisions in favor of BFC Dynamo gave rise to speculation that the dominance of BFC Dynamo was not solely due to athletic performance, but also due to help from referees.[174] BFC Dynamo was a representative of both the Stasi and the capital. The team was therefore viewed with more suspicion than affection.[175][174] The overbearing success of BFC Dynamo in the 1980s made fans of opposing teams easily aroused as to what they saw as manipulation by bent referees.[173][176] The team was met with aggression and shouts such as \"Bent champions!\" (German: Schiebermeister) and \"Jews Berlin!\" at away matches.[177][4][178][179] Complaints of alleged referee bias accumulated.[173][4][180] The German Football Association of the GDR (DFV) eventually conducted a secret review of the 1984-85 DDR-Oberliga.[173][167][181] Among other things, the review found that BFC Dynamo had earned only one third of the yellow cards incurred by rival SG Dynamo Dresden.[182][183][181] A review was also made of the final of the 1984-85 FDGB-Pokal final between BFC Dynamo and SG Dynamo Dresden. This review found that 30 percent of the referee decisions were wrong, and that 80 percent of those had been of disadvantage to SG Dynamo Dresden.[184][185][186][181] A number of referees were sanctioned for their performances in matches involving BFC Dynamo in the following months, including the referees involved in the cup final.[4][186][181]\n\nA particularly controversial episode was the penalty awarded to BFC Dynamo by referee Bernd Stumpf in extra time in the match between 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig and BFC Dynamo on 22 March 1986. The penalty caused a wave of protests.[167][187][174] SED General Secretary Erich Honecker and Secretary for Security, Youth and Sport of the SED Central Committee Egon Krenz were fed up with the \"football question\" and the \"BFC-discussion\".[167] An example was consequently made out of referee Stumpf. He was permanently banned from refereeing by the DFV.[165] The sanctions against Stumpf were approved by Honecker and Krenz in the SED Central Committee.[188][189] However, a previously unknown video recording of the match was published by Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk (MDR) in 2000. The video recording showed that the penalty was correctly awarded and that the sanctions against Stumpf were unjustified.[165][178][190]\n\n\"I can imagine there was referee manipulation due to the immense pressure from the government and Ministry for State Security. That could have made some referees nervous and influenced their decisions. But we were the strongest team at the time. We didn\'t need their help.\"\n\nFalko Götz[191]\nThe benefit of controlling important matches in Western Europe might have put indirect pressure on the referees to take preventive measures, in so-called preventive obedience.[192][193][194][195][175] In order pursue an international career, a referee would need a travel permit, confirmed by the Stasi.[188][181][196] It become known after the German reunification that several referees had also been Unofficial collaborators (IM) of the Stasi.[167][197][198][199] However, there is no evidence to show that referees were under direct instructions from the Stasi and no document has ever been found in the archives that gave the Stasi a mandate to bribe referees.[197][194][200][201]\n\nThe picture that the success of BFC Dynamo relied upon referee bias is dismissed by former BFC Dynamo players and coaches. Some of them admit that there might have been cases of referee bias, but they all insist that it was the thoroughness of their youth work and the quality of their play that earned them their titles.[202][174][191][203] Former coach Jürgen Bogs has said: \"You cannot postpone 26 matches in one season in the DDR-Oberliga. At that time we had the best football team\".[204][190][nb 6] BFC Dynamo was able to filter the best talents through nationwide screening and train them in its youth academy. The youth academy had full-time trainers employed for every age group.[206] As a trainer of the DDR-Oberliga team, Bogs worked with modern training methods, such as video evalutations, which was not yet common in East Germany. The club also applied heart rate and lactate measurements during training, which only came to the Bundesliga many years later.[207][190] Former referee Bernd Heynemann has concluded: \"The BFC is not ten times champions because the referees only whistled for Dynamo. They were already strong as a bear.\"[208]\n\nLast titles in East Germany (1986–1989)\n\nMarco Köller (left) and Heiko Scholz of 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig (right) during the match between the two teams on 22 August 1987.\nFrank Rohde was the new team captain for the 1986–87 season.[209] BFC Dynamo recruited 20-year-old attacking midfielder Thomas Doll from relegated F.C. Hansa Rostock for of the 1986–87 season.[209] Doll and Andreas Thom would form one of the most effective attacking duos in East German football in the late 1980s. BFC Dynamo defeated 1. FC Union Berlin 8–1 in the derby on the fourth matchday of the 1986-87 DDR-Oberliga.[210][211] The East Germany U19 team won the 1986 UEFA European Under-18 Championship, after defeating Italy 3–1 in the final on 15 October 1986. BFC Dynamo was represented by two youth players in the squad: midfielder Marco Köller and defender Hendrik Herzog.[212] [213] Köller and Herzog would then make their debuts for BFC Dynamo in the DDR-Oberliga during the 1986–87 season.[214][215] The team met fierce competition from 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig in the 1986–87 DDR-Oberliga. BFC Dynamo met 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig away on the 20th matchday at the Bruno-Plache-Stadion on 11 April 1987.[216] The two teams had the same number of points going into the match.[217] BFC Dynamo won the match 1–3.[216] The team eventually finished the 1986-87 DDR-Oberliga in first place, 6 points ahead of runner-up SG Dynamo Dresden and 8 points ahead of third-placed 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig.[218]\n\n\nAndreas Thom during a match against SG Dynamo Dresden on 6 April 1988.\nBFC Dynamo was eliminated in the first round of the 1987-88 European Cup after double defeats against FC Girondins de Bordeaux. Also the 1987-88 DDR-Oberliga meant firece competition from 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig. BFC Dynamo finished the first half of the season as Herbstmeister. The team had the same number of points as second-placed 1. FC Lokomotiv Leipzig and led the league only on goal difference.[219] Andreas Thom was the top scorer in the league by a wide margin, with 14 goals in 13 games in the first half of the season.[220] The second half of the 1987-88 DDR-Oberliga was a tight race against 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig until the end. BFC Dynamo and 1. FC Lokomotive were level on points heading into the final matchday, but BFC Dynamo had the better goal difference.[221] BFC Dynamo defeated FC Vorwärts Frankfurt 1–0 at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark on the final matchday and won its tenth consecutive DDR-Oberliga title. The winning goal was scored by Burkhard Reich.[222] The team then defeated FC Carl Zeiss Jena 2–0 in front of 40,000 spectators at the Stadion der Weltjugend in the final of the 1987–88 FDGB-Pokal and finally completed the Double.[223] Andreas Thom was eventually voted the 1988 East German footballer of the year.[224]\n\n\nAndreas Thom receiving the 1988 East German footballer of the year award from the Die Neue Fußballwoche (de) editor-in-chief Jürgen Nöldner on 13 August 1988.\nLong-time club president Manfred Kirste was replaced by Herbert Krafft ahead of the 1988–89 season.[225] Krafft had a background in the Volkspolizei.[226] BFC Dynamo was drawn against West German champions SV Werder Bremen in the first round of the 1988-89 European Cup. The first match was played at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark. Among the spectators was the former West German Chancellor Willy Brandt. BFC Dynamo sensationally won the match 3–0.[227] Bodo Rudwaleit was a match hero, with numerous saves.[228] However, the team lost the return leg at the Weser-Stadion with 5–0. The return leg in Bremen would become known as the second \"Miracle on the Weser\".[228][227] It has been rumored that the spectacular loss in the return leg was explained by BFC Dynamo having been given doping before the home game in East Berlin.[105][229] A more likely explanation, however, is that the players could not cope with the enormous pressure before the return leg.[229] It has also been rumored that the players were distracted from their pre-match preparations by shopping opportunities, which had been arranged by SV Werder Bremen manager Willi Lemke.[229][230] BFC Dynamo lost important points to its league rivals in the autumn and finished the first half of the season in fourth place, a full nine points behind SG Dynamo Dresden. It was the team\'s worst result after a first half of the season in the league in 14 years.[231]\n\nAverage attendance had dropped from 15,000 to 9,000 during the team\'s most successful years in the 1980s.[173] Ordinary fans feared the Stasi and had become disillusioned with political interference. Particularly aggravating were the restrictions on ticket sales that the Stasi imposed at international matches for political reasons. Only a few tickets were sold to ordinary fans for matches in the European Cup against opponents such as Hamburger SV and SV Werder Bremen. The majority was instead sold to a politically hand-picked audience.[190][232] BFC Dynamo also saw the emergence of a well-organized hooligan scene during the 1980s.[174][178] The development was partly a response to the increasing state repression against the supporter scene.[190]\n\n\nThe team celebrates the victory in the 1988-89 FDGB-Pokal at the Stadion der Weltjugend on 1 April 1989.\nBFC Dynamo met local rival 1. FC Union Berlin on the 16th matchday of the 1988-89 DDR-Oberliga on 18 March 1989. 1. FC Union Berlin now fielded as many as four former BFC Dynamo players in the starting line-up: Olaf Seier, Mario Maek, Thomas Grether and Norbert Trieloff.[233] BFC Dynamo reached the final of the FDGB-Pokal for the second consecutive season. The team met Karl-Marx-Stadt in the final of the 1988-89 FDGB-Pokal. BFC Dynamo won the match 1–0 in front of 35,000 spectators at the Stadion de Weltjugend and captured its second consecutive cup title. The winning goal was scored by Anderas Thom in the 57th minute.[234] BFC Dynamo eventually finished the 1988-89 DDR-Oberliga as runner-up. Defender Jens-Uwe Zöphel and midfielder Jörn Lenz from the youth department made their debuts for BFC Dynamo in the DDR-Oberliga during the 1988–89 season.[235][236]\n\nHelmut Jäschke replaced Jürgen Bogs as coach for the 1989–90 season.[237] As the winner of the 1988-89 FDGB-Pokal, BFC Dynamo was set to play the DFV-Supercup against new league champions SG Dynamo Dresden. The match was played at the Stadion der Freundschaft in Cottbus on 5 August 1989.[238] BFC Dynamo won the match 4-1 and thus became the first and only winner of the DFV-Supercup in the history of East German football.\n\nGerman reunification and decline (1989–2004)\nMain article: History of Berliner FC Dynamo (1989–2004)\nThe Peaceful revolution, FC Berlin and failed promotion (1989–1991)\n\nThe new BFC Dynamo coach Helmut Jäschke during the match against FC Rot-Weiß Erfurt on the first matchday of the 1989-90 DDR-Oberliga on 12 August 1989\nThe 1989–90 season was tumultuous for BFC Dynamo. Frank Pastor was transferred to BSG Aktivist Schwarze Pumpe at the beginning of the season. BFC Dynamo was qualified for the 1989–90 European Cup Winners\' Cup as winners of the 1988–89 FDGB-Pokal. The team was eliminated in the second round by AS Monaco on the away goals rule. Coach Helmut Jäschke then decided to place young goalkeeper Oskar Kosche in the following match. Long-time goalkeeper Bodo Rudwaleit ten suddenly announced his immediate retirement from football.[239] The East German regime faltered under pressure from political mass demonstrations and events in neighboring countries. Parts of the Berlin Wall were opened on 9 November 1989 and East German citizens could now freely travel to West Berlin. The Stasi was transformed into the Office for National Security (German: Amt für Nationale Sicherheit) (AfNS) on 17 November 1989.[240] The transformation also ended the tenure of Erich Mielke as Minister of State Security.[241] He would soon be dismissed as the First Chairman of SV Dynamo as well.[242][226] Andreas Thom was signed to Bayer Leverkusen by Bayer Leverkusen manager Reiner Calmund. The transfer became official on 12 December 1989. Thom thus became the first player in the DDR-Oberliga to leave for the West German Bundesliga.[243] The transfer fee amounted to 2,5 million Deutsche Mark.[243]\n\n\nThe team of FC Berlin at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark on 23 February 1990.\nBodo Rudwaleit was transferred to BSG Stahl Einsenhüttenstadt and Bernd Schulz to BSG Bergmann-Borsig during the 1989–1990 winter break. The dismantling of the team from the 1980s was now well underway.[244] Coach Jäschke was dismissed during the winter break and was replaced by Peter Rohde.[245] Rohde had played 159 league- and 14 international matches for BFC Dynamo between 1969 and 1978 and was an older brother of team captain Frank Rohde.[245] The AfNS was eventually completely dissolved on 13 January 1990.[240] With the dissolution of the Stasi, BFC Dynamo had lost a major sponsor. The Ministry of the Interior announced that it was only prepared to support the club until the end of the 1989–90 season.[246][247][248] The fate of the club was uncertain. BFC Dynamo was rebranded as FC Berlin on 19 February 1990.[249][250] Club President Herbert Krafft was dismissed at the same time and Jürgen Bogs took over as interim president until new club elections could be held.[249] The team participated in the first edition of the indoor tournament \"Internationales Berliner Hallenfussballurnier\" in the Werner-Seelenbinder-Halle. Teams from West Berlin, such as Hertha BSC also participated. FC Berlin lost the final against arch-rival 1. FC Union Berlin with 4–5. Thomas Doll became the best goal scorer of the tournament with 12 goals.[251] The second half of the season started well, but it soon became clear that FC Berlin would not would not have a chance at the title.[252] FC Berlin finished the 1989-90 DDR-Oberliga in fourth place and failed for the first time in a long time to qualify for a European tournament.[253] Attendance dropped from 7,271 in the fall of 1989 to just 3,383 in the spring of 1990.[254] The team lost Thomas Doll and Frank Rohde to Hamburger SV and Rainer Ernst to 1. FC Kaiserslautern after the season.[255][256]\n\n\nDirk Rehbein chasing the ball during a match between FC Berlin and HFC Chemie at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark on 10 November 1990.\nThe team was joined by Dirk Rehbein from SC Fortuna Köln during the summer of 1990. FC Berlin participated in the 1990 Intertoto Cup 30 June 1990 and 17 July 1990. FC Berlin had sold off almost all its offensive players during the 1989–90 season and the team finished the tournament in third place.[257][258][259] FC Berlin also recruited Mikhail Pronichev from FC Lokomotiv Moscow for the 1990–91 season.[260][261] The team began the 1990-91 NOFV-Oberliga with four consecutive defeats and was in last place in the league after the fourth matchday. Jürgen Bogs returned as coach.[262][263] A wave of hooliganism swept through East Germany in 1990.[178] One of the largest hooligan scenes in Germany was formed around FC Berlin.[253] 18-year-old FC Berlin supporter Mike Polley was shot dead by police during riots in Leutzsch in connection with the match between FC Sachsen Leipzig and FC Berlin on 3 November 1990. The police had fired between 50 and 100 shots in one minute.[264] The hooligan scene of FC Berlin would shape the entire 1990–91 season.[265] FC Berlin continued to struggle in the second half of the league season. The team was in 12th place in the league towards the end of the season.[266] However, FC Berlin won its last two matches in the league, against Chemnitzer FC and FC Victoria 91 Frankfurt, and finished the 1990-91 NOFV-Oberliga in 11th place.[266] The team was thus qualified for the play-off for the 2. Bundesliga. FC Berlin was one point behind leaders BSV Stahl Brandeburg before the final round. The team defeated 1. FC Magdeburg 3–5 away, but BSV Stahl Brandenburg defeated 1. FC Union Berlin 0–2 away. FC Berlin thus finished in second place and just narrowly failed to qualify for the 2. Bundesliga.[267][268][257] The team lost several key-players after the season, such as Heiko Bonan, Burkhard Reich, Waldemar Ksienzyk, Thorsten Boer, Eike Küttner and Hendrik Herzog.[268][269]\n\nDecline (1991-1994)\nFC Berlin recruited midfielder Ralf Rambow from Eisenhüttenstädter FC Stahl for the 1991–92 season. The 1991–92 season was the first season when teams from East Germany and teams from West Germany played in the same league system. The NOFV-Oberliga was now at third tier in the league system. FC Berlin was qualified for the 1991-92 DFB-Pokal as a participant in the 1990–91 2. Bundesliga play-off. It was the club\'s first participation in the DFB-Pokal. The team was drawn against SC Freiburg. The starting eleven included players such as Oskar Kosche, Christian Backs, Jens-Uwe Zöphel, Jörg Fügner, Mario Tolkmitt and Mikhail Pronichev. FC Berlin lost the match 0–2.[270] Heiko Brestrich returned to the team during the summer of 1991.[271] Brestrich would be a key-player of FC Berlin in the 1990s. FC Berlin came to dominate the 1991-92 NOFV-Oberliga. The team lost only two matches during the entire league season and scored a total of 97 goals.[272] FC Berlin was once again qualified for the play-off for the 2. Bundesliga. The team finished the play-off in third place. Volkswagen-backed VfL Wolfsburg won the play-off, which meant that no team from the former East Germany was able to advance.[272] FC Berlin lost 11 players after the 1991–92 season, including Mario Tolkmitt, Christian Backs, Jörn Lenz, Jörg Fügner and Oskar Kosche.[273][274] In total, FC Berlin lost two complete teams in the first one or two years after the fall of the Berlin Wall.[256]\n\nFailing to win win promotion to the 2. Bundesliga, FC Berlin had to continue at amateur level. The main competitors in the following seasons of the NOFV-Oberliga Nord were teams such as Tennis Borussia Berlin, BSV Stahl Brandenburg and Eisenhüttenstädter FC Stahl. With the many player departures after the 1991–92 season, Jürgen Bogs once again had to build a new team.[273] FC Berlin recruited forward Bernd Jopek for 1. FC Union Berlin and midfielder Stefan Oesker from Blau-Weiß 1890 Berlin for the 1992–93 season.[273] The team was also strengthened by a number of youth players.[273] FC Berlin now had to rely on its youth department to supply the team with new players.[275] The team finished the 1992-93 NOFV-Oberliga Nord in fourth place. Dirk Rehbein and Ralf Rambow left for 1. FC Union Berlin after the season.[276][277] FC Berlin was no longer the absolute treasure trove among former East German clubs, but continued to produce talent thanks to its excellent youth work.[277] Among the players from the youth department on the squad in 1993–94 season were Jens Reckmann, Mike Jesse, Ronny Nikol, Michael Franke, Marcell Fensch and Rayk Schröder.[278][275][273][276][277] The team of FC Berlin that played against Spandauer SV on the fifth matchday on 9 September 1993 had an avagerage age of only 21,33 and was the youngest team of BFC Dynamo to have ever played a competitive match.[279] Helmut Koch replaced Jürgen Bogs as coach on 28 September 1993.[280] FC Berlin finished the 1993-94 NOFV-Oberliga Nord in fourth place and qualified for the new Regionalliga Nordost.\n\nRegionalliga Nordost and first Berlin cup title (1994–1999)\nMario Kallnik returned to the club for the 1994–95 season. The re-instated Regionalliga would now form the new third tier in the German football league system. The 1994-95 Regionalliga Nordost meant new meetings with well-known opponents such as FC Carl Zeiss Jena, 1. FC Union Berlin and FC Rot-Weiß Erfurt.[281] BFC Dynamo struggled in the 1994-95 Regionalliga Nordost, but managed to retain its place in the league.[282] Jens-Uwe Zöphel left the team for FC Energie Cottbus after the season. The team was joined by goalkeeper Daniel Bartel from the youth department for the 1995–96 season. Bartel became the new first-choice goalkeeper at the beginning of the season. The highlights of the 1995-96 Regionalliga Nordost were new meetings with old rival 1. FC Dynamo Dresden.[283] The two teams had not met since the 1990–91 season.[284][281] The first meeting was played in front of 2,002 spectators at the Stadion im Sportforum on 8 September 1995. The score was 1–3 at half break.[283] The match ended 4–3 to 1. FC Dynamo Dresden.[284][281] Club President Klaus Bittroff resigned on 14 September 1995 and Vice president Volkmar Wanski became the new club president.[285] The team had a difficult start to the 1995-95 Regionalliga Nordost. Due to acute danger of relegation, coach Koch was dismissed on 17 October 1995. Werner Voigt became the new coach.[286][287] Voigt had a long background in the club as a player and coach. With Voigt, the experienced defender Mario Maek also returned to the club.[286] FC Berlin organized one of the biggest youth football tournaments so far in the eastern part of the country in the Sportforum Hohenschönhausen on 6–8 April 1996. As many as 30 youth teams from clubs such as Chelsea F.C., Everton F.C., Feyenoord, FC Bayern München and Borussia Dortmund participated.[288][287] FC Berlin found itself in the relegation zone towards the end of the 1995-95 Regionalliga Nordost.[289] The place in the league was saved with a 1–0 win over FSV Wacker 90 Nordhausen on the 33rd matchday, 19 May 1996. The winning goal was scored by Mario Maek.[283]\n\nExperienced players such as Heiko Brestrich, Mario Maek, and Jens Reckmann would form the team\'s backbone during the 1996–67 season.[290] FC Berlin defeated 1. FC Dynamo Dresden 2–0 in the opening match of the 1996–97 Regionalliga Nordost in front of 2,300 spectators at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark.[291] Then followed a sharp decline.[292] The team would lose 6–0 away to its other rival 1. FC Union on the ninth matchday.[293] It was the biggest loss to date against 1. FC Union Berlin.[294] Club President Wanski announced on 26 November 1996 that the financial reserves had been used up.[287] The millions of Deutsche Mark that the club had made from player transfers in the early 1990s were now gone.[295] Wanski would then support the club every year with personal contributions.[296][297] During the second half of the 1995–96 season, he became shirt sponsor with his own company Regio Bautenschutz GmbH.[290] The shirts had not had a sponsor in almost seven years.[290] FC Berlin also signed a two-year sponsoring contract with the Italian sportswear manufacturer Fila during the spring of 1996, where Fila became the club\'s equipment sponsor. The club previously had no equipment sponsor.[298] Fila had reportedly been impressed by the club\'s youth work.[298] FC Berlin finished the 1996-67 Regionaliga Nordost on 13th place after another weak season. Mikhail Pronichev left the team for TuS Makkabi Berlin and Jens Reckmann for 1. FC Dynamo Dresden after the season.\n\nThe team recruited Croatian defender Davor Krznarić for the 1997–98 season. The 1997-98 Regionalliga Nordost was also a struggle, with the team in 12th place in the league at the winter break.[299] The club still received New Year\'s greetings from Real Madrid and Liverpool F.C. in 1997.[300] Experienced defender Jörn Lenz returned to the club during the winter break.[301] Lenz would be a key player for several seasons to come. The successes in the Regionalliga Nordost had not materialized. It became known that coach Voigt had signed for 1. FC Dynamo Dresden for the 1998–99 season. The club and Voigt decided to part ways.[302] Assistant coach Ingo Rentzsch took over on 12 March 1998.[303] The team played an exciting 5–5 draw away against 1. FC Magdeburg away on the 33rd matchday, 5 May 1998. Bernd Jopek, Jörn Lenz, Davor Krznarić, Marek Seruga, and Mario Kallnik scored one goal each in the match.[303][304] New coach for the 1998–99 season was Henry Häusler.[305] Players central to the team in the 1998–99 season were Heiko Brestrich, Jörn Lenz, Mario Maek, Martino Gatti, Mario Kallnik, Davor Krznarić, Timo Lesch, and Sven Ohly, with Lenz as team captain.[305][306] Coach Häusler was eventually dismissed on 18 March 1999 and assistant coach Ingo Rentzsch again took over as interim coach.[307] Club President Wanski came up with the idea to revive the old name BFC Dynamo during the autumn of 1998. He said: \"We stand by Dynamo\'s sporting tradition, we reject the club\'s political past.\"[308][297] An overwhelming majority at the general meeting on 8 May 1999 voted to take back the old name.[309] The team met local rival Union Berlin on the penultimate matchday of the 1998-99 Regionalliga Nordost, 8 May 1999. The team now again competed as BFC Dynamo. Coach Rentzsch threw in the towel at half-time and left the stadium, allegedly because Club President Wanski had wanted to dictate the line-up.[310][311][312] Youth trainer Norbert Paepke took over as coach in the second half of the match.[310][313] BFC Dynamo won the derby 2–0 with two goals by Marcel Solomo in front of 2,543 spectators at the Stadion an der Alten Försterei.[314] BFC Dynamo reached the final of the 1998-99 Berlin Cup. The team defeated Berlin Türkspor 1965 with 4–1 in the final on 11 May 1999 and finally won its first Berlin Cup title. Ayhan Gezen and Mario Maek scored one goal each, and Heiko Brestrich scored two goals for BFC Dynamo in the final.[315]\n\nRelegation to NOFV-Oberliga and crash (1999–2001)\nBFC Dynamo recruited goalkeeper Nico Thomaschewski for the 1999–2000 season. Thomaschewski became the new first-choice goalkeeper. Torsten Boer, Jens Reckmann and Dirk Rehbein also returned to the club.[316][317] The team was also joined by forward Marcel Riediger from the youth department. Marcel Riediger was the son of former BFC Dynamo striker Hans-Jürgen Riediger.[318][319] The team lost 0–2 to Arminia Bielefeld the first round of the 1999-2000 DFB-Pokal.[320] BFC Dynamo defeated SG Dynamo Dresden 1–0 on the sixth matchday.[316] The team stood at a sensational second place in the league after the eight matchday, but then followed a sharp descline.[321][322] BFC Dynamo suffered a period of crisis during the autumn of 1999.[323] The financial difficulties had continued. The number of sponsors was too few and the club was financially dependent on Club President Volkmar Wanski. The number of spectators also remained low and new sponsors were deterred by hooliganism.[311] The team went through several league matches without a single win. Heiko Brestrich eventually rebelled against coach Klaus Goldbach in early November 1999 and was suspended. He was then sacked and transferred to VfB Leipzig.[324][325][326][327] Brestrich was very popular with the supporters of BFC Dynamo and was popularly called \"Heiko Brestrich - Football God\" (German: Heiko Brestrich - Fußballgott).[324][328] He had played a total of 301 matches for BFC Dynamo during his career, including 282 matches between 1991 and 1999.[324][329] The team was joined by Russian striker Denis Kozlov later the same month. Kozlov would eventually prove successful at BFC Dynamo. Coach Goldbach was eventually dismissed in early December 1999 and Jürgen Bogs returned for his third stint as coach.[330]\n\nThe club finally got a promising main sponsor in the form of the software company Lipro AG at the beginning of 2000.[331][332] However, the difficulties in the league continued and the club\'s liabilities had already started to become significant.[332] BFC Dynamo finished the 1999-2000 Regionalliga Nordost in 17th place and was relegated to the NOFV-Oberliga Nord. For the first time in its history, BFC Dynamo was now a fourth tier team.[333] BFC Dynamo reached the final of the Berlin Cup for a second consecutive season, but lost the final of the 1999-2000 Berlin Cup 2–0 against the reserve team of Tennis Borussia Berlin.[334] Club President Wanski resigned on 29 June 2000.[335][336][337] The reason was allegedly that the sponsor Lipro AG demanded greater influence in club decision making.[335][336] The club was now temporary in the hands of Sports director Hans Reker.[335] Mario Maek retired as a player after the 1999–2000 season and several players left the team, including Thorsten Boer and Martino Gatti.[335][336] A new team was put together for the 2000-01 NOFV-Oberliga Nord. The budget for the season was 2.3 million Deutsche Mark, which set new record for the NOFV-Oberliga Nord.[336] The team was joined by striker Dirk Vollmar, Cameroonian midfielder Aka Adek Mba, Brazilian midfielder Alexandre Vieira dos Santos, nicknamed \"Macalé\", as well as five Romanian players: Dănuț Oprea, Silvian Cristescu, Aurel Panait, Dorel Zegrean, and Florin Bătrânu.[336][338] SPD-politician Karin Halsch became new club president on 27 September 2000.[339][340][nb 7] BFC Dynamo dominated the 2000-01 NOFV-Oberliga Nord. The team was drawn against arch-rival 1. FC Union Berlin in the quarter-finals of the 2000-01 Berlin Cup The match was played in front of 4,427 spectators at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark on 24 March 2001. BFC Dynamo lost 3–0.[341] Serious riots broke out after the match when BFC Dynamo supporters clashed with the police.[342] The team finished the 2000-01 NOFV-Oberliga in first place, with only three losses in 34 matches.[343] Denis Kozlov had scored a wopping 29 goals for BFC Dynamo in the league.[343] The team would now face 1. FC Magdeburg in a play-off for promotion to the Regionalliga Nord.\n\nHowever, it had become apparent that the club had serious financial problems two weeks before the play-offs. Players and coaches had received their January salaries in March and had not received any salaries since. The club was also behind with insurance payments.[344][345][346] The German Football Association (DFB) demanded that the club could provide a bank guarantee of 4.2 million Deutsche Mark to secure the budget for the possible 2001–02 Regionalliga Nord. It was already clear before the first match in the play-offs that the club would have difficulty meeting the requirements of the DFB in the event of promotion.[343][347] The first match of the play-offs ended 0–0 in front of 8,282 spectators at the Stadion im Sportforum on 2 June 2001.[348] The second match was played at the Ernst-Grube-Stadion in Magdeburg on 9 June 2001. Around 2,000 supporters from BFC Dynamo traveled to the second match.[349][350] The score was 2–2 at half time. BFC Dynamo was practically promoted at this point.[348] However, the team ultimately lost the match 2–5.[348][351] The club\'s debts were now estimated at 1.5 million Deutsche Mark.[352] And now, also the main sponsor Lipro AG was in financial trouble.[353][354] Several players left the club directly after the 2000–01 season, including Marcel Riediger and Denis Kozlov.[343][352]\n\nInsolvency (2001–2002)\nInsurance company AOK filed for insolvency against BFC Dynamo on 21 June 2001. The company demanded 126,000 Deutsche Mark in unpaid insurance payments.[355] Club President Karin Halsch resigned on 25 June 2001.[355] There had been major discrepancies between Halsch and sports director Hans Reker regarding how the situation should be resolved.[355] Reker took over as acting president.[356] Supporters of BFC Dynamo started the fundraiser \"Save BFC Dynamo\" (German: Rettet den BFC). The fundraiser quickly succeeded in raising 40,000 Euros.[357][358][359] More players left the team during the summer of 2001, including Mario Kallnik and Aka Adeck Mba.[360] The debts were estimated at 5 millions Deutsche Mark, of which 4.2 million were loans from Lipro AG and 1.3 short-term debts, at this point.[361] The club tried to initiate a partnership with FC Dynamo Moscow, in which BFC Dynamo would serve as a farm team for FC Dynamo Moscow in Europe.[362] But the plan led nowhere.[363] A preliminary insolvency administrator was appointed at the end of August 2001.[364] It was estimated that insolvency proceedings could be opened on 1 November 2001.[365] Insolvency proceedings were opened against main sponsor Lipro AG on 5 October 2001.[366]\n\nThe preliminary insolvency administrator estimated the club\'s debts at 6 million Deutsche Mark.[367] BFC Dynamo needed 30,000 Deutsche Mark by 31 October 2001 in order to commence insolvency proceedings.[368] However, the club did not have the money.[369] Discussions with new sponsors failed.[370] If insolvency proceedings could not be opened, the club would go bankrupt and have to restart in the Kreisliga under a new name.[363][365][371][368] Supporters organized a demonstration that marched from the Sportforum Hohenschönhausen to the Rotes Rathaus. Also former players such as Hans-Jürgen Riediger, Rainer Troppa, Waldemar Ksienzyk and Heiko Brestrich planned to participate. The demonstration was received at the Rotes Rathaus by former club president and SPD-politician Halsch.[369][372][368] A group of sponsors around former president Volkmar Waski finally came forward and offered the money required to commence insolvency proceedings.[373][374] The club\'s entire presidium resigned on 31 October 2001.[375][337] An emergency board formed by André Sommer, Rayk Bernt and press spokesman Holger Zimmermann was appointed by the club\'s Economic Council.[376][370]\n\nBFC Dynamo is said to have made millions on player sales after Die Wende.[356][377][378] The club was for a time considered the richest amateur club in Germany.[295] But not all the money had went to the club, some had also went to SV Dynamo, DFV and advisers.[379][380] The club\'s reputation as the former Stasi club made it difficult to win new sponsors.[296][381][356][382] The club was also plagued by hooliganism, which repeatedly caused negative headlines.[382][340] FC Berlin failed to qualify for the 2. Bundesliga and never progressed beyond the third tier of the German football league system.[383] The number of spectators was only a couple of hundred per match in the early 1990s and the income from membership fees was marginal.[382][383] The club also maintained a large youth department which at one point cost about 400,000 Deutsche Mark per year.[382] At the end of 1996, the club still had no debts, but also no money left in its bank accounts.[296] President Wanski would then have to support the club with his own financial contributions.[296] It is estimated that Wanski invested an estimated 3 million Deutsche Mark of private money in the club over the five years before his resignation.[384] BFC Dynamo finally got a promising new sponsor in the form of Lipro AG in early 2000. Millions of Deutsche Mark would now be available.[385] But the club\'s liabilites had already started to become significant.[385] The club made a bid to reach the third tier Regionalliga Nord, and sports director Hans Reker started signing new players.[385] However, the millions from sponsor Lipro AG would later turn out to be loans.[385]\n\nThe emergency board was considered to represent the interest of the sponsor group around Wanski.[386] André Sommer and Rayk Bernt were controversial due to their membership in the Hells Angels.[387] However, both were also long-time supporters; Sommer had been a member of the hooligan scene back in the 1980s.[388][389] Zimmermann resigned from the emergency board on 23 November 2001, as he thought Sommer and Berndt had given the club an image he could not identify with.[390] A new presidium was due to be elected at a general meeting on 26 November 2001.[337] But the general meeting was converted into an \"information event\" by a vote of 87 to 59, at the insistence of the emergency board.[390][391] Some club members felt they had been blackmailed.[391] Sommer and Bernt continued to lead the club during the opening of the insolvency proceedings, but the legitimacy of their presidium was questioned.[390]\n\nInsolvency proceedings were opened on 1 November 2001.[392][393][394] BFC Dynamo was thus automatically relegated to the Verbandsliga Berlin.[372] All contracts with professionals and employees were terminated.[372][395][396][393] The club now had to continue under amateur conditions, the players could only be offered 300 Euros per month.[369][337] Only three players from the original squad remained for the first mandatory friendly match, one of them was team captain Piotr Rowicki.[397][337] Jörn Lenz left for VfB Leipzig and Nico Thomaschewski for SV Babelsberg 03.[337] Coach Jürgen Bogs also decided not to continue.[374][398] Former assistant coach Mario Maek stepped in as the new coach on a voluntary basis, assisted by goalkeeping coach Bodo Rudwaleit.[398] The club once again had to rely on its youth players.[399]\n\nSommer and Bernt met great opposition due to their membership in the Hells Angels.[400] The duo had a deterrent effect and failed to attract new sponsors.[388][401] Supporters collected signatures to elect a new presidium.[388][402] But the signatures were ignored by Sommer and Berndt.[388][402] The former coach of the women\'s team Volkmar Lucius then took legal action for violation of the statutes.[388][402] The Sommer and Bernt presidium was then finally overthrown by supporters and Lucius, through a successful application to the Charlottenburg District Court.[388][402][401] The court appointed Lucius as an emergency board member on 30 April 2002.[388][403] Sommer and Bernt had, after all, helped make sure that the insolvency proceedings could be opened by their personal financial contributions.[402][404] But the duo would no longer have much say in the club after 2003.[405] The interest group IG BFC\'er managed to persuade entrepreneur Mike Peters to become the new club president.[401][404] Peters was elected as the new president on 31 May 2002.[406] The preferential claims of 204,000 Euros looked insurmountable.[401] But the supporters had negotiated with creditors and received numerous waivers.[401][407] They had also set up a donations account and collected at least 13,800 Euros themselves.[407][406] The new presidum around Peters would also contribute 100,000 Euros from private money to the insolvency plan.[406][401][407] Peters also committed to funding a large part of the budget for the 2002-03 Verbandsliga Berlin.[406][408]\n\nRestart in Verbandsliga Berlin and end of insolvency (2002–2004)\nFormer BFC Dynamo player Dirk Vollmar became the new coach for the 2002–03 season.[406] Bodo Rudwaleit continued as assistant coach.[406] Nico Thomaschewski and Aka Adeck Mba returned for the 2002–03 season.[409][410] The team was also joined by defender Robert Rudwaleit from the reserve team.[411][408][412] Robert Rudwaleit was the son of Bodo Rudwaleit and had made his first few appearances with the first team during the previous season.[413] BFC Dynamo defeated the reserve team of 1. FC Union Berlin in both meetings in 2002-03 Verbandsliga Berlin.[414] The team eventuallty finished its first season in the Verbandsliga Berlin in third place.[414] The insolvency situation was complex. The club had about 170 creditors. It was still unclear whether the insolvency proceedings could be successful.[415]\n\nJörn Lenz returned to the club for the 2003–04 season.[416] BFC Dynamo also recruited striker Danny Kukulies from SC Pfullendorf for the season. Kukulies had a long background in the youth department of BFC Dynamo.[417] BFC Dynamo was in third place after the first half of the season, nine points behind BFC Preussen and six points behind second placed SV Tasmania Gropiusstadt 73.[418] The team defeated SV Tasmania Gropiusstadt 73 2–1 in the first league match after the winter break, with one goal by Lenz and one goal by Robert Rudwaleit.[419] The team would also win the following matches.[420] BFC Dynamo eventually finished the 2003-04 Verbandsliga Berlin in first place and won promotion back to the NOFV-Oberliga Nord. The team had won all 17 matches in the second half of the league season, which set new record in the Verbandsliga Berlin.[421] Danny Kukulies scored 32 goals and Tomasz Suwary 22 goals in the 2003-04 Verbandsliga Berlin.[422] The insolvency proceedings would finally come to a positive conclusion after a meeting with the creditors at the Charlottenburg District Court on 8 June 8, 2004. The 192 creditors received an insolvency rate of 0.25 percent.[423][422] The insolvency proceedings were then finally declared closed by the Charlottenburg District Court on 16 June 2004, after one complaint was dismissed.[424]\n\nConsolidation, Regionalliga Nordost and Berlin Cup success (2004-present)\nMain article: History of Berliner FC Dynamo (2004–present)\nConsolidation (2004-2010)\nMario Weinkauf was elected as new club president at the annual meeting on 18 June 2004. His vision for BFC Dynamo was a club that was \"managed seriously from a sporting and financial perspective\".[425][426] Former professional player Christian Backs became the new coach for the 2004–05 season.[427] Central players in the team in the 2004–05 season were Robert Rudwaleit, Nico Thomaschewski, Dennis Kutrieb, Jörn Lenz, Danny Kukulies and Tomasz Suwary.[428][429] There were several outbreaks of riots and hooliganism among the supporters of BFC Dynamo during the season.[430][431] The club management decided not to apply for a license to the Regionalliga Nordost despite the team being in third place in the league at the start of the second half of the season. The financial consolidation was not yet complete.[432] Coach Backs left for Berliner AK 07 before the end of the season due to financial disagreements with the club.[433] BFC Dynamo finished its first season in the NOFV-Oberliga Nord since its return in sixth place.\n\nFormer FC Vorwärts Frankfurt player Jürgen Piepenburg took over as new coach for the 2005–06 season.[434] Jens-Uwe Zöphel also returned to the club. BFC Dynamo was debt-free ahead of the 2005–06 season.[435] BFC Dynamo negotiated a lucrative sponsorship agreement with the energy company United Sol Energy. The company\'s representative in Berlin was the Belgian former FC Bayern Munich goalkeeper Jean-Marie Pfaff.[436][435][437] The plan also included the founding of a new youth sports school at BFC Dynamo that would bear Pfaff\'s name.[437] New riots broke out among supporters in connection with the match against SV Yeşilyurt on first matchday of the 2005-06 NOFV-Oberliga Nord on 5 August 2005. As many as 13 police officers were injured in the riots.[438][439] The 2005-05 NOFV-Oberliga Nord involved new derbies against 1. FC Union Berlin. The first meeting was to be played at the Stadion an der Alten Försterei on 12 August 2005. Police carried out a controversial raid against supporters of BCF Dynamo the night before the match at the discothèque Jeton in Friedrichshain. Up to 158 people were arrested and 39 people were injured.[439][440] The players of BFC Dynamo held a vote on whether the team should play the derby or not, and decided with a narrow majority to play.[441] BFC Dynamo lost the match 8–0. Coach Piepenberg was dismissed after the match.[442]\n\nBFC Dynamo came to play with the logo of United Sol Energy on their shirts at the beginning of the season, despite the fact that the club had yet to receive any money.[443][444] It eventually became clear that there would be no money from United Sol Energy.[445][446] Club spokesman Yiannis Kaufmann resigned from all posts in September 2005 due to disagreements over the club\'s policy regarding sponsors. The club had received sponsorship money from companies with alleged links to Hells Angels.[447][448][449][450][451] André Sommer was considered the strong man in the background.[451] BFC Dynamo turned 40 years on 15 January 2006. The anniversary was celebrated with a party for supporters with 750 guests.[452] The club management worked to ensure that the club would no longer be associated with hooligans and the far-right scene. The Israeli fashion brand JetLag became a new sponsor at the turn of the year and Weinkauf also planned a training camp in Israel.[453] The club decided not to extend the sponsorship agreements with several controversial sponsors at the beginning of 2006. The index included companies with links to Hells Angels.[453] The return match against 1.

The reason given was the stagnation at the end of the league season.[623] New coach for the 2022–23 season was Heiner Backhaus.[624]\n\nColours and crest\nThe colours of BFC Dynamo are claret and white.[625] The colours were inherited from SC Dynamo Berlin and followed the claret colour scheme of SV Dynamo. BFC Dynamo has been playing in claret and white since the club\'s founding, with the exception of a period in the 1990s. The BFC Dynamo home kit has traditionally been a claret shirt, paired with claret or white shorts and socks. The team is occasionally nicknamed \"die Weinroten\", which means \"the Clarets\".[626][627]\n\nThe BFC Dynamo away kit has traditionally been a white shirt, paired with claret or white shorts and socks. However, the team used green away shirts from the end of the 1960s until the mid-1970s.[628][83] Green was the colour of the Volkspolizei, which was the official sponsor of BFC Dynamo during the East German era. The green away shirt was then exchanged for a white away shirt, paired with red or white shorts and socks.[93][99] The team used entirely red away kits during the 1981–82 and 1982–83 seasons.[629][630] The red away kit was then exchanged for a claret away kit.[631] The team again used white away shirts from the 1985–86 season.[632] The 1985–86 season also saw the instruction of a new claret and white diagonally striped away shirt.[632] The diagonally striped away shirt would be used for the rest of the 1980s.[237]\n\nThe club was rebranded as FC Berlin on 19 February 1990. A pure white was set as the new match colour with immediate effect.[633] FC Berlin then adopted a red and white colour scheme for the 1990–91 season.[634] In the eyes of the supporters, the red and white kit looked a lot like 1. FC Union Berlin.[634] The club played in red and white home kits for most of the FC Berlin era, but wore a black and red striped home shirt, paired with black shorts and socks from the 1996–97 season through the 1998–99 season. The club returned to its original club name on 3 May 1999 and consequently also later returned to its traditional colour scheme.[635]\n\n1966-1990, 1999–2009, 2023-\n1966-1990, 1999–2009, 2023-\n\n \n2009-2023\n2009-2023\n\nThe crest of BFC Dynamo during the East German era featured a stylized \"D\" for SV Dynamo and the lettering \"BFC\" in red and yellow on a white background, surrounded by a yellow wreath.[636][637] BFC Dynamo abandoned its East German crest when the club was rebranded as FC Berlin on 19 February 1990.[638][639][636] The club used two different crests during the FC Berlin era. The first crest featured a stylized image of the roof of the Brandenburg Gate with the lettering \"FCB\" underneath and the club name \"Fussballclub Berlin\" in capital letters at the bottom, in white on a red background. It was only briefly used during the spring of 1990.[640] The second crest featured a stylized image of a football with the Brandenburg Gate in front, the lettering \"FCB\" at the top and the club name \"FC Berlin\" at the bottom, in red on a white background. This crest was used from the spring of 1990 until the end of the FC Berlin era.[640][284]\n\nBFC Dynamo reclaimed its East German crest when the club returned to its original club name on 3 May 1999.[639] But the club was no longer in possession of the crest.[639] The club had neglected to seek legal protection for its East German crest after German reunification. The neglect was likely due to managerial inexperience. Protection of trademarks was neither necessary nor common in East Germany.[636] The crest was now owned by Peter Klaus-Dieter Mager, commonly known as \"Pepe\". Pepe Mager was a famous fan of Hertha BSC and a fan merchandise dealer.[641] The club tried to recover the crest from Mager though court action, without success.[639][636] The ownership of the crest was instead passed on to Rayk Bernt and his company RA-BE Immobilien- und Handelsgesellschaft mbH.[479][642][643]\n\nBFC Dynamo continued to use the disputed crest on its kits and webpage. But the club would have to ask the owner of the crest every time it wanted to have a pennant made and was unable to exploit the commercial value of the crest for its own benefit.[479][516] The legal situation around the crest would also have caused problems in the event of an advance to the Regionalliga, as the German football Association (DFB) required clubs to own their crests.[517] In order establish independence, the club finally decided to adopt a new crest in 2009.[467]\n\nThe new crest abandoned the traditional stylized \"D\" and the lettering \"BFC\", as they would have met legal obstacles.[643] The new crest featured a black Berlin bear on claret and white stripes, together with the club name and the founding year.[643] The first version of the new crest sparked controversy. The word \"fußball\" in the club name had been written in lower case with a double \"s\" instead of the graphene \"ß\".[643] This was contrary to German spelling rules, where it is only permissible to write \"fußball\" with a double \"s\" when the word is written in upper case. Club President Norbert Uhlig ensured that there was absolutely no ulterior motive behind the spelling and claimed that the word had always been spelled like that on club pennants and scarfs.[643] The Chairman of the Economic Council Peter Meyer later claimed that the spelling was a deliberate marketing ploy, in order to have new crest immediately known across Germany.[643] A second version of the crest was soon made public, where the club name was written in upper case. The new crest was used by BFC Dynamo from the 2009–10 season.[516]\n\nBFC Dynamo finally managed win back the traditional crest in 2022, through the Chairman of the Economic Council Peter Meyer. Meyer had acquired the rights to the crest through one of his companies.[644] From the 2023–24 season, BFC Dynamo is once again playing with its traditional crest. The traditional crest was displayed for the first time since its reintroduction in a friendly match against Hertha BSC in front of more than 10,000 spectators at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark on 7 July 2023.[645][646]\n\nOwnership of the traditional crest\nMany clubs in East Germany rushed to drop their East German names during the Peaceful revolution. BFC Dynamo was among the clubs to do so, in an attempt to distance the club from the Stasi.[639][250] The club was rebranded as FC Berlin on 19 February 1990 and consequently abandoned its East German crest.\n\nPepe Mager was a famous fan of Hertha BSC and fan merchandise dealer.[641] Mager had organized away trips for the fans Hertha in the early 1960s and was one of the founders of the notorious supporter group \"Hertha-Frösche\". He now sold his own fan merchandise from a mobile stand outside the Olympiastadion.[641][647][648] Mager inquired with the register of associations in Charlottenburg in 1991 about all deleted names of East German clubs.[641] He immediately found BFC Dynamo and saw business opportunities.[641][639] Mager claimed that he first secured the former crest of BFC Dynamo for 80 D-Marks in 1992.[381][643]\n\nThe name FC Berlin never became popular with the fans.[250] Fans continued to identify themselves with the former name and crest.[639] An overwhelming majority voted for the club to take back its original club name at the general meeting on 3 May 1999.[635] Of the 135 present, 125 voted in favor, three against and seven abstained.[309] BFC Dynamo thus reclaimed its East German crest, but the rights to the crest now belonged to Mager.[639] Mager had registered the crest in his name at the German Patent and Trademark Office on 13 May 1997.[639][649][636]\n\nBFC Dynamo contacted Mager for a co-operation, but an agreement could not be reached.[641][649] Mager held the opinion that the club should buy its merchandise from him, or simply buy the rights to the crest.[639] He later informed the club that he had received interest from foreign buyers and offered the club to buy the rights.[649] He claimed that the crest was worth 200,000 D-Marks.[639] BFC Dynamo on the other hand claimed that the crest should legally belong to the club. The club sued Mager in court on 20 November 2000, but eventually lost the case.[639][636] The club decided to suspend the legal dispute with Mager in the summer of 2001 and instead wanted to find a solution outside court.[650] Mager was repeatedly exposed to minor threats from the environment around BFC Dynamo and eventually sold the crest to Rayk Bernt and his company RA-BE Immobilien- und Handelsgesellschaft mbH for a price of 50,000 D-Marks in June 2002.[479][642][517][651]\n\nBernt was a close associate of André Sommer.[652] Bernt and Sommer had assisted the club at the opening of the insolvency proceedings in 2001–2002.[652][453][479] Both were long time fans of BFC Dynamo.[653][479][642] But the duo was controversial for their connections to Hells Angels.[653][652] Bernt and Sommer were almost as restrictive towards the club when it came to the crest as Mager had been. Bernt organized the production of fan merchandise in his own regime.[642] The club would have to ask his company every time it wanted to have a pennant made.[479] Bernt and Sommer usually agreed, manufactured the pennant and then sold it at their own fan merchandise stand at the stadium.[479] BFC Dynamo continued to use the crest and would at times be given ten percent of the revenues from their sales.[453][479][642][643] The club eventually offered 5,000 Euros for the crest, but was turned down.[453] Sponsor Peter Meyer was also said to have offered 150,000 euros for the buyback.[478] Bernt demanded a seven-digit sum, according to former Club President Mario Weinkauf.[453] The lawyer representing RA-BE Immobilien- und Handelsgesellschaft mbH allegedly claimed the crest was worth around 600,000 Euros at the time.[654]\n\nPresident Weinkauf planned to recover the rights to the former crest with the help of Thomas Thiel and the company Treasure AG before the general meeting on 23 June 2007. Thiel was a co-owner of Treasure AG, which was intended as a new major sponsor.[479] Bernt sold parts of the rights to the former crest to Thiel.[655] The price was allegedly a six-digit sum.[479][643] According to the plan, the club would be given the rights of use to the crest. The profits would thus go to the club. The club would pay a symbolic sum of 1 Euro per month for the rights of use. BFC Dynamo would then have a right of first refusal after the ten-year contract had expired and thus have the opportunity to eventually acquire ownership of the crest.[479][656] However, Weinkauf was ultimately rejected by club members in a vote of no-confidence at the general meeting on 23 June 2007.[485] Weinkauf would then be contacted by the former president of Tennis Borussia Berlin Peter Antony. Treasure AG became a sponsor of Tennis Borussia Berlin instead and Weinkauf would later become president of the club.[480]\n\nThiel sold his rights to the crest back to Bernt and his company BFC Dynamo Vermarktungsgesellschaft m.b.H in 2009.[657] The rights to the old crest where subsequently controlled again by the company RA-BE Immobilien- und Handelsgesellschaft mbH.[658][659] The company is controlled by Bernt, who sold occasional items with the former crest at his own webpage.[638] However, RA-BE Immobilien- und Handelsgesellschaft mbH transferred its rights to company AXXON AG in 2022.[660][661] In connection with the club\'s 57th anniversary in 2023, the Chairman of the Economic Council Peter Meyer revealed in an exclusive interview with Berliner Kurier that he had acquired the rights to the crest for the club through one of his companies. After more than 13 years, the traditional crest was finally back with the club. According to Berliner Kurier and Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk (MDR), a six-digit sum is said to have become due.[644][662]\n\nChampionship star\nThe German Football League (DFL) introduced a system of championship stars in the 2004–05 season. The system was meant to honor the most successful teams in the Bundesliga by allowing teams to display stars on their shirts for the championships they have won. The system awarded one star for three titles, two stars for five titles, and three stars for ten titles.[663] However, the system only counted titles won in the Bundesliga since the 1963–64 season.[664][665][666]\n\nBFC Dynamo submitted an application to the DFL and the DFB on 9 August 2004 to receive three stars for its ten titles in the DDR-Oberliga. The club asked for equal rights and argued that the German Football Association (DFB) had absorbed the German Football Association of the GDR (DFV) with all its statistics, international matches and goal scorers.[663][667][668][664] BFC Dynamo received support from Dynamo Dresden and 1. FC Magdeburg in its attempts to achieve recognition for East German titles.[667][664]\n\nThe DFL responded that it was not the responsible body, but the DFB remained silent for a long time.[665] The DFB eventually declared itself responsible and recommended BFC Dynamo to submit a formal application for a new title symbol in accordance with a relevant paragraph.[664][665] BFC Dynamo commissioned a law firm in Mitte in January 2005 and sent a new letter to the DFB. The DFB announced that the application from BFC Dynamo was going to be negotiated in a meeting with the DFB presidium.[665] The meeting with the DFB presidium on 18 March 2005 agreed that all titles won in East Germany, as well all others titles won in Germany since the first recognized championship in 1903, should qualify for stars.[669] However, the decision was subject to approval by the DFL.[670] No final decision had yet been made by the DFB presidium.[671][672][673][674]\n\n\nBFC Dynamo is allowed to wear one star inscribed with the number ten for its ten East German championships.\nHowever, BFC Dynamo took matters in its own hands and unilaterally emblazoned its shirts with three stars.[672] The team displayed the three stars for first time in the match against FC Energie Cottbus II on 25 March 2005.[672] The claim by BFC Dynamo was controversial because the club had been the favorite club of Erich Mielke and had had a connection to the Stasi during the East German era.[672][673][675][676][666] Critics in the DFB environment pointed to politically influenced championships in East Germany. BFC Dynamo had been sponsored by the Stasi and had enjoyed advantages.[665] The club had privileged access to talents and a permanent training camp at Uckley in Königs Wusterhausen. However, also other clubs in East Germany had enjoyed similar advantages, which put the DFB in a difficult situation.[665] Also former East German referee and CDU parliamentarian Bernd Heynemann spoke out for recognition of all East German titles.[666]\n\nThe DFL rejected the application from the DFB and recommended the DFB to only honor clubs that were champions in the Bundesliga.[677] However, the DFB chose to not follow the recommendation. The DFB presidium instead decided on a compromise solution on 19 July 2005 and adopted a new regulation for the 2005–06 season which gave all clubs the right to wear one single star for the championships they have won in the former East Germany and in Germany since 1903. Clubs were also allowed to indicate the number of championships they have won in the center of the star.[678][679][680] The regulation only applies to clubs playing in a league under the DFB umbrella. It does not apply to clubs playing in the 2. Bundesliga and Bundesliga, which are organized by the DFL.[679]\n\nThe new regulation meant that BFC Dynamo was finally allowed to emblazon its shirts with a championship star. The regulation also affected other former East German teams including Dynamo Dresden with its eight titles, 1. FC Frankfurt with its six titles and Magdeburg with its three titles in the Oberliga.[665][680] BFC Dynamo has since then used the championship star in accordance with DFB graphic standards, displaying a star inscribed with the number ten for its ten East German titles.[681]\n\nStadiums\nMain article: Stadion im Sportforum\nThe long-time home and training facility of BFC Dynamo is the Sportforum Hohenschönhausen in Alt-Hohenschönhausen in Berlin. The sports complex is the location of the club offices and the clubhouse.[637] It is also the base of the youth teams.[637] More than 20 youth teams of BFC Dynamo regularly train at the facilities.[682] The Sportforum Hohenschönhausen is considered the spiritual home of the club.[637]\n\nThe Sportforum Hohenschönhausen was known as the Dynamo-Sportforum during the East German era.[683] The sports complex was built as a training center for elite sport and was home to sports club SC Dynamo Berlin, with its many departments and squads.[684][685] Development began in 1954 and expansion continued into the 1980s.[686] The Sportforum is still unique as of today.[687] The sports complex covers an area of 45 to 50 hectares and comprises 35 sports facilities as of 2020.[684][687][688][689]\n\n\nA match between SC Dynamo Berlin and SC Turbine Erfurt at the Walter-Ulbricht-Stadion in 1959.\nSC Dynamo Berlin played its first season at the large Walter-Ulbricht-Stadion in Mitte.[17][690] The team moved its home matches to the football stadium in the Dynamo-Sportforum for the short transitional 1955 season.[691] SC Dynamo Berlin returned to the Walter-Ulbricht-Stadion for the 1956 season.[690] The team would play at the Walter-Ublricht-Stadion for the rest of the 1950s.[690]\n\nSC Dynamo Berlin eventually moved its home matches permanentely to the Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum after the construction of the Berlin wall began on 13 August 1961.[17][692] The football stadium in the Dynamo-Sportforum held a capacity of 10,000 spectators at the beginning of the 1961–62 season.[683][nb 8] The team drew average attendances between 3,000 and 6,000 spectators in the DDR-Oberliga at the Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum in the 1960s.[704][705] The highlights were matches against local rival ASK Vorwärts Berlin and the various top teams during the period. The capacity of the football stadium in the Dynamo-Sportforum was gradually expanded during the 1960s.[692][nb 9]\n\n\nA match between BFC Dynamo and BSG Chemie Leipzig at the Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum in 1966.\nBFC Dynamo began playing occasional matches that required floodlights at the larger Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark in Prenzlauer Berg from November 1968.[692] The Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark was the home ground of FC Vorwärts Berlin at the time. However, the stadium became vacant when FC Vorwärts Berlin was relocated to Frankfurt an der Oder on 31 July 1971.[63] BFC Dynamo played its home matches in the 1971-72 European Cup Winners\' Cup at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark.[708] The matches against Åtvidabergs FF in the quarter-finals on 22 March 1972 and FC Dynamo Moscow in the semi-finals on 5 April 1972 were each attended by 30,000 spectators.[709][710] The team also played two home matches in the 1971-72 DDR-Oberliga at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark.[711] However, more matches at the stadium were not possible after the summer of 1972, as the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark was then undergoing extensive renovation for the upcoming 10th World Festival of Youth and Students.[690]\n\nBFC Dynamo was qualified for the 1972-73 UEFA Cup. However, neither the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark nor the Walter-Ulbricht-Stadion were available for the upcoming UEFA Cup matches. Both were undergoing extensive renovation for the 10th World Festival of Youth and Students. Instead, the Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum underwent a complete transformation in just five weeks between the end of July 1972 and September 1972.[690] The capacity of the Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum was now expanded to 20,000 spectators.[712][713][692] BFC Dynamo played all home matches in the 1972-73 UEFA Cup at the Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum. The attendance of 20,000 spectators during the match against Liverpool on 29 November 1972 is still a record attendance for the stadium.[696] BFC Dynamo remained at the Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum for a couple more seasons. The team saw rising attendance numbers at the Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum during the 1970s.[714] An average of 12,000 people attended the last six matches of BFC Dynamo at the Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum in the second half of the 1973–74 season.[692] The match between BFC Dynamo and 1. FC Magdeburg in the 1974-75 DDR-Oberliga at the Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum on 8 March 1975 was attended by a whole 19,000 spectators.[715]\n\n\nA match between BFC Dynamo and SG Dynamo Dresden in front of 25,000 spectators at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark in 1976.[716]\nBFC Dynamo eventually moved its home matches to the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark for the 1975–76 season, due to upcoming repair work at the Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum.[692] The move was meant to be temporary, but eventually became permanent.[692] The Dynamo-Sportforum would primarily serve as a training facility from then and the football stadium would be used mostly by the reserve team BFC Dynamo II. The Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark held a capacity of 30,00 spectators in the 1975–76 season.[708] The average home attendance of 16,538 spectators for BFC Dynamo at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Stadion in the 1975-76 DDR-Oberliga is the highest average league attendance in club history.[17][717] BFC Dynamo celebrated nine of its ten DDR-Oberliga titles in the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Stadium. The team also played most of its home matches in the UEFA competitions at the stadium. BFC Dynamo hosted teams such as Shakhtar Donetsk, Red Star Belgrade, Nottingham Forest, Hamburger SV, Aston Villa, AS Roma FC Aberdeen at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Stadium in the 1970s and 1980. However, all matches in the derby against 1. FC Union Berlin were played at the neutral Stadion der Weltjugend from the 1976–77 season for security reasons.[294][718][719][720]\n\nA permanent training camp for BFC Dynamo was built in Uckley in the Zernsdorf district of Königs Wusterhausen in Bezirk Potsdam at the end of the 1960s.[721] It was located in the woods and completely sealed off from the surroundings.[721][722] The training camp covered an area of around 10 hectares.[722] The complex was equipped with a boarding school, several football pitches, a sports hall, a swimming pool, a fitness area and a sauna.[723][724][725][722][726] The team would gather in Uckley days before its European matches.[17] The players would have access to catering facilities, a nearby lake, a bowling alley, a cinema and pinball machines, among other things.[725][726]\n\n\nThe team of BFC Dynamo in front of the new grandstand of the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark in 1987.\nBFC Dynamo moved its home matches temporary to the Dynamo-Sportforum for the 1986–87 season, as the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark was undrgoing redevelopment during the season for the upcoming 750th anniversary of Berlin.[692][708] The team also played its home matches in the 1986-87 European Cup at the Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum. The team then returned to the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark for the 1987–88 season.[727] The Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark now had a new four storey grandstand and new floodlight masts. The current grandstand and the floodlights of the stadium dates from this time.[696] The club was rebranded as FC Berlin after Die Wende. FC Berlin moved permanently to the Stadion im Sportforum at the beginning of the 1992–93 season.[696] The team would remain in the Sportforum Hohenschönhausen for many seasons to come.[692]\n\nThe capacity of the Stadion im Sportforum had been reduced to about 12,000 spectators by 1992.[692] FC Berlin only drew an average of a couple of hundred spectators per match at the Stadion im Sportforum in the mid-1990s. The highlights were the matches against 1. FC Union Berlin. FC Berlin under Club President Volkmar Wanski announced plans in April 1998 to buy and modernize the stadium.[300] However, the plans eventually failed due to lack of funds. The team saw rising attendance numbers at the Stadion im Sportforum at the end of the 1990s.[714] Active supporters of BFC Dynamo were traditionally found at the northern curved end, popularly known as the Nordwall stand.[717] 4,220 spectators watched the match between BFC Dynamo and Union Berlin at the Stadion im Sportforum on 23 November 1999.[728]\n\nSupporters of BFC Dynamo installed new bucket seats on the main stand and built a new clubhouse next to the main stand of the Stadion im Sportforum in 2002–2003.[729] The Stadion im Sportforum was then equipped with a 25-metre player tunnel and plexiglass-clad coaching benches in November 2004.[730] BFC Dynamo made new plans for a modern football stadium in the Sportforum Hohenschönhausen in 2006 under Club President Mario Weinkauf. The club now wanted to build a new modern stadium for 10,000–15,000 spectators.[731] However, these plans did not materialize either. The Stadion im Sportforum was closed at the end of the 2005–06 season following the riots during the match between BFC Dynamo and Union Berlin on 13 May 2006.[457] BFC Dynamo temporarily had to move to the Friedrich-Ludwg-Jahn-Sportpark.[461] The stadium was then refurbished in 2006–2007 to increase safety and meet the requirements of the NOFV.[487] The refurbishment included a new fence.[732]\n\n\nA match between BFC Dynamo and SV Babelsberg 03 on 23 April 2017.\nBFC Dynamo won promotion to the Regionalliga Nordost at the end of the 2013–14 season. The team moved permanently to the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark for the 2014–15 season, due to increased media and spectator interest following its promotion.[696][733] The 2014-15 Regionalliga Nordost meant matches against well-known opponents such as 1. FC Magdeburg and FC Carl Zeiss Jena. The more central location of the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark was seen by the club as an opportunity to attract more spectators.[733] The match between BFC Dynamo and 1. FC Magdeburg on 8 November 2014 was attended by 5,103 spectators.[734] Active supporters of BFC Dynamo have traditionally been found on the main stand, and on the side opposite the main stand (German: die Gegengerade) of the Friedrich Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark.[717] The match between BFC Dynamo and FC Schalke 04 in the first round of the 2018-19 DFB-Pokal at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark on 17 August 2017 was watched by 14,117 spectators.[570] The attendance was the highest attendance for BFC Dynamo since the fall of the Berlin wall.[570][86] The average league attendance of BFC Dynamo in the 2017-18 Regionalliga Nordost would also be the highest average league attendance of BFC Dynamo since the 1990-91 season.[705]\n\nBFC Dynamo had to play a number of matches at the Stadion im Sportforum at the end of the 2018–19 season due to safety issues relating to the dilapidated floodlights at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark.[735] The move was greeted by some supporters as a move to the true home of the club.[736] The club was then set to return to the Sportforum in the 2020–21 season as the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark was planned to be demolished for a complete redevelopment.[637] The team was allowed to continue play in the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark until 31 December 2020.[737] BFC Dynamo then officially announced on 21 March 2021 that the club was going to move back to the Sportforum Hohenschönhausen for the next season.[738]\n\nThe Stadion im Sportforum was equipped with a floodlight system in April 2021.[739][740] The club organized a work effort in the summer of 2021 to get the stadium in shape for the upcoming Regionalliga season. [741] Supporters of BFC Dynamo gathered and cleared sections of the old stadium from weeds.[742] Members of the interest group IG BFC\'er also restored the iconic manual scoreboard above the curved end towards the Weißenseer Weg in time for the first home match of the 2021–22 season against Energie Cottbus on 28 July 2021.[743] The attendance for BFC Dynamo at the Stadion im Sportforum in the 2021-22 Regionalliga Nordost was almost tripled compared to the last comparable league season before the COVID-19 pandemic. 3,219 people watched the match between BFC Dynamo and FC Carl Zeiss Jena on 10 April 2022.[744]\n\nFuture stadium\nThe large stadium in the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark is planned to be demolished towards the end of 2023 for a complete redevelopment.[745] The new stadium im the Fredrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark is designed as an inclusive sports facility. The stadium will hold 20,000 spectators and meet the requirements for play in the 3. Liga and 2. Bundesliga.[746][747][745] BFC Dynamo will be able to play matches at the new stadium. The new stadium in the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark is planned to be opened in 2028.[748]\n\nSupporters\nEast German era\nBFC Dynamo played only a minor role in football in Berlin until the relocation of FC Vorwärts Berlin to Frankfurt an der Oder in 1971.[717] The club initially had modest support, but with its growing successes in the 1970s, the club began to attract young fans, primarily from the central areas around the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark, such as Prenzlauer Berg and Mitte.[174] Many came from working class families in Prenzlauer Berg.[749] One of the first big supporter groups of BFC Dynamo was Black Eagle. The fan club was founded in 1972 and was one of the earliest fan clubs in East German football. Fans of BFC Dynamo were the first to sew their embroidered fan club badges on their jackets. This was a novelty among football supporters in East Germany in the 1970s.[750]\n\nThe supporter scene became a focal point for various subcultures in the late 1970s and beginning of the 1980s.[751][520][752] There were punks, rockers, hippies and a few early skinheads.[751][717][753][754][137] Some were left-leaning and others were right-leaning.[751][754] Football and stadium life offered free spaces that were difficult for the authorities to control.[137] For some fans, being part of the supporter scene was an opportunity to rebel against the East German regime.[751] Most supporters of BFC Dynamo had little to do with the state. It was more important for them to protest, do their own thing and break out from everyday life.[717] Despite cheering for a club associated with the Stasi, supporters of BFC Dynamo were not loyal to the line.[751] Many active fans of BFC Dynamo in the 1980s were against the regime.[177][754] Some supporters would even cut out the \"D\" for SV Dynamo from their club patches. They considered the \"BFC\" to be free from the Stasi, while they thought the \"D\" symbolized the exact opposite.[755]\n\n\"We provoked with chants and slogans. We were right, left, punk, hippie, skinhead. We were direct and provocative, kind and evil, in love, or drunk. Cool words were always well received. Right or left, I don\'t want to classify one. We were all in our fan group against the GDR, rebellion!\"\n\n– A fan of BFC Dynamo in the 1980s[756]\nYoung people were gradually attracted by the provocative image of the club: its successes, its reputation as a Stasi club and the hatred of opposing fans.[520][752] Some fans of BFC Dynamo found delight in the unpopularity of their club and took pride in the hatred they met.[754][757][32] One fan recalled that the 1980s \"were my greatest years, as we always had glorious success in provoking other fans\" and another one that \"we were really hated by everyone\".[757] Fans of BFC Dynamo would sometimes respond to the hatred they met by singing chants in praise of Erich Mielke as a provocation.[758] They would also throw tropical fruits, that were only available in East Berlin, at home fans during away matches in Saxony.[178][753]\n\nBFC Dynamo came to be associated with areas such as Prenzlauer Berg, Pankow, Weißensee, Hohenschönhausen and certain cafés and restaurants in vicinity of Alexanderplatz.[759][760] The supporter scene included groups such as Black Eagle, Norbert Trieloff, Bobbys, Iron Fist, Beatles BFC Club, Die Ratten, Berliner Wölfe, Heavy Horses, Black Pahnter and Madness boys of Preussen in the 1980s.[761] Fashion played a big role in the BFC Dynamo supporter scene.[32][754] Football supporters in East Berlin shared a sense of superiority over their counterparts in the regional districts.[760][751] This was also the case with the supporters of Union Berlin, but notably with the supporters of BFC Dynamo.[760][762][177][763]\n\nFootball-related violence spread in East Germany in the 1970s.[137][764] The supporter scene of BFC Dynamo was still young at the time, while clubs such Union Berlin and BSG Chemie Leipzig had large followings.[32] A trip to Leipzig or Dresden was a difficult task.[717] Supporters of BFC Dynamo responded to the hostile environment, and learned to compensate their smaller numbers, by being more aggressive and better organized.[765][174][32][766] The dislike against BFC Dynamo in stadiums around the country and the hatred of opposing fans welded its supporters together.[767] One fan of BFC Dynamo said: \"This feeling of being hated is what makes it so appealing.\" A saying among the supporters of BFC Dynamo was: \"We are few, but we are awesome!\" (German: Wir sind wenig, wir sind geil!)[768][32] One fan of BFC Dynamo recalled: \"It was really rumbling at away trips, and only then you felt your own strength. When we went with 200 people against 1,000 Unioners and you noticed: If you stick together, you have an incredible amount of violence.\"[769] Supporters of BFC Dynamo would eventually gain a reputation for being particularly violent and organized.[174] One fan of Union Berlin recalled: \"There was hardly an enemy mob against us, we were just too many... But the people who stood in the way of the violence-seeking BFC:ers were very few... The BFC:ers were completely organized. These hundred and fifty people, everyone knew each other. They stood as a block like a wall.\"[770] The book \"Riot Boys!\" by Jochen Schramm depicts the supporter scene of BFC Dynamo and contains stories of violent away trips in the early 1980s. Jochen \"Ellis\" Schramm was a member of the hooligan scene of BFC Dynamo in the 1980s.[771]\n\nThe development in the supporter scene of BFC Dynamo would eventually catch the attention of the authorities. The Stasi conducted a study on the violent structures of the supporter scene at the beginning of the 1980s. It found that 80 percent of those committing violent acts were 16–25 years old. Most of them were workers or students.[760] It also found that 20 percent came from families of the socialist intelligentia.[177][760] The Stasi assigned a group of two full-time officers from the district administration to the supporter scene during 1982–83 season.[772] From then, supporters of BFC Dynamo were accompanied, observed and documented.[773] This was a measure that had previously also been applied to the supporter scene of Union Berlin.[178] The authorities had allegedly been particularly alarmed when supporters of BFC Dynamo unfurled a poster in memory of Lutz Eigendorf with the text \"Iron Foot, we mourn you!\" during a match at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark in April 1983.[774][773][174] Supporters had also started a fan club in honour of Eigendorf.[753] The Stasi would try to control the supporter scene with a broad catalogue of measures: persistent talks, intimidation attempts, reporting requirements and arrests.[717][751] It would also attempt to infiltrate the fan clubs by unofficial collaborators (IM).[772] All football fan clubs in East Germany had to undergo registration.[137] According to Stasi information, BFC Dynamo had six registered fan clubs and 22 unauthorized fan clubs in 1986. Unauthorized fan clubs were those that were unregistered or did not meet DFV guidelines.[775] East German state television always tryied to hide riots from viewers. But the sound recording from football matches was the biggest problem. Additional sound systems were integrated into the stadium of BFC Dynamo for radio and television broadcasts. The system was also supposed to drown out shouts and chanting from the violent structures, so that television viewers and radio listeners would not hear anything.[776]\n\nThe supporter scene of BFC Dynamo came to be increasingly associated with skinheads and far-right tendencies from the mid-1980s.[174] More and more supporters of BFC Dynamo began to embrace skinhead fashion in the early 1980s.[751][717] Skinhead fashion was now considered the most provocative outfit.[751] By the mid-1980s, the club had become one of the most popular football clubs in the growing skinhead movement.[32][nb 10] The reputation of BFC Dynamo as the hated Stasi club also attracted skinheads, who used the club as a stage for their provocations.[520] Right-wing slogans and fascist chants were considered as the most challenging provocations, as anti-fascism was state doctrine and Nazism officially did not exist in East Germany.[783][137][174][751][784][637] For young people, being a Nazi was sometimes considered the sharpest form of opposition.[785] However, instances of Nazi provocations did not necessarily reflect genuine political convictions. At least some part of the \"drift to the right\" among East German youth during the 1980s was rooted in a desire to position oneself wherever the state was not.[786] One fan of BFC Dynamo said: \"None of us really knew anything about politics. But to raise your arm in front of the Volkspolizei was a real kick. You did that and for some of them, their whole world just fell apart\".[787][717][174][nb 11]\n\nThe first East German hooligan group developed from the supporter scene of BFC Dynamo in the 1980s. The development was partly a response to the increasing state repression against the supporter scene, notably from the Stasi.[190] An organized hooligan scene with groups, structures and training rooms, that was unique in East Germany, would eventually emerge at BFC Dynamo.[766] The hooligans of BFC Dynamo initially reacted with restraint to police intervention in the fan block. There was a risk of going to jail. However, the Volkspolizei were sometimes ruthless, especially at away matches. Towards the end of the 1980s, there was an uprising and the hooligans of BFC Dynamo now began to confront the police with violence.[794] The final of the 1987-88 FDGB-Pokal between BFC Dynamo and Carl Zeiss Jena on 4 June 1988 saw some of the most serious violence ever witnessed at an East German football match.[4] A group of 100 to 150 skinheads and other hooligans marched through Pankow to the Stadion der Weltjugend for the match. They chanted fascist slogans and clashed with other supporters.[795][779] Riots then broke out in one of the blocks shortly before the end of the match. Supporters destroyed fences and threw seats at match stewards.[796] A group of 300 supporters of BFC Dynamo attempted to invade the pitch during the victory ceremony. They caused extensive damage to 60 seating benches.[786] About a year later, supporters of BFC Dynamo would also destroy large parts of a block of the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark, during the match against AS Monaco in the 1989–90 European Cup Winners\' Cup on 1 November 1989.[797][798][nb 12]\n\nGerman reunification\nA wave of violence swept through the football stadiums of East Germany in 1990.[178] The collapse of the East German regime resulted in a security vacuum.[800][801][802] The Volkspolizei was overwhelmed by the amount of disorder and often reluctant to use enough force, due to the political situation.[803][178][804][264]\n\n\nSupporters of FC Berlin during the away match against FC Carl Zeiss Jena on 8 April 1990.\nMasked supporters of FC Berlin rioted in central Jena before the away match against FC Carl Zeiss Jena in the 1989-90 DDR-Oberliga on 8 April 1990. They broke shop windows, smashed windscreens of police vehicles with stones and left a trail of destruction in the city center. Supporters of FC Berlin also fired flares at police officers during the match.[805] The disorder at the stadium would not cease and the match was eventually interrupted.[32] The riots in Jena caught rare attention by East German state media, which until then had been generally silent about football related disorder.[32][751]\n\n\nA flare thrown on the pitch during the match between FC Carl Zeiss Jena and FC Berlin on 8 April 1990.\nThere were now riots now after every home match in FC Berlin. After the last home match in the 1989-90 NOFV-Oberliga against BSG Wismut Aue on 26 May 1990, a group of 300 supporters of FC Berlin marched from Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark towards Alexanderplatz. Windows were smashed, cars were damaged and a minibus was overturned as they made their way. Supporters met at the Marx-Engels-Forum. A group of 200 people then formed a human swastika in front of the Volkspolizei. There were 21 arrests, and the police seized knives, knuckle dusters and pepper spray.[806]\n\nHooligans who had left East Germany for various reasons in recent years rejoined the hooligan scene after the opening of the Berlin Wall.[265][807] Some were former skinheads who had been deported by the Stasi to West Germany in the late 1980s. Now they chanted things such as \"Who should be our Führer? Erich Mielke!\" as a provocative fun, to the dismay of the club.[265][804] Supporters who returned from West Germany also brought back a new fashion based on designer clothing labels and expensive sportswear, which was adopted by the supporter scene.[265][767] While combat boots and bomber jackets were now common at many places in East Germany, some supporters of BFC Dynamo wanted to differentiate themselves. Expensive sneakers was now the new fashion in the supporter scene.[717][807][808] Brands such as Diesel, Iceberg, Chevignon, Adidas, Best Company, New Balance and Ray Ban became popular.[767][265][808][760]\n\nThe reputation of the hooligans of FC Berlin attracted a large number of new young people who joined the hooligan scene.[265] A series of violence occurred in connection with the cup match between Union Berlin and FC Berlin in the Second round of the 1990-91 FDGB-Pokal on 23 September 1990. Hooligans of FC Berlin stormed the home stands of the Stadion an der Alten Försterei armed with clubs and flares and hunted down supporters of Union Berlin.[263][809] Riots broke out after match. Aound 250 hooligans threw gravel and other objects at the police. At least 14 police officers were injured in the clashes.[810] Serious riots then continued in the city, involving hundreds of supporters. Street battles broke out in areas of East Berlin, even spreading to Kreuzberg in West Berlin.[811] One supporter of FC Berlin said: \"In 1990, thanks to the many departures to the West, it became clear relatively quickly that there was no flowerpot to be won with the current team. We then turned our attention to other things.\"[812]\n\nHooligans in East Germany unleashed almost unbridled violence against the representatives of the disintegrating East German state.[802] Violent riots had occurred in Rostock, Dresden, Erfurt and East Berlin.[802] Police had been forced to shoot warning shots during violent riots in Leipzig and one match in the 1990-91 NOFV-Oberliga had already been abandoned due to riots in the stadium.[803][813][814][815][nb 13] The situation peaked during a match between FC Sachsen Leipzig and FC Berlin on 3 November 1990. Supporters of FC Berlin travelled in large numbers to Leipzig for the match.[802] The police had only 219 officers available for the match.[264] There were clashes at the Leipzig main railway station, with one police officer injured and 50 supporters taken into custody.[264][816] A first group of around 100 supporters of FC Berlin entered the Georg-Schwarz-Sportpark in time for kick-off.[802] They were joined by a hooligans of 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig, who had forced their way into the stadium.[817][818][819][777] Supporters of both camps tried to attack each other in the stadium and the police had difficulties in maintaining a buffer zone.[264] A second group of up to 400 supporters of FC Berlin arrived later at the nearby Leipzig-Leutzsch S-Bahn station at Am Ritterschlößchen street.[802][264] Fireworks were fired as they made their way to the stadium.[820] The group was blocked from entering the stadium by police equipped with helmets and shields, despite showing valid tickets.[821][822][265] The supporters were not given any reason.[820] They were then pushed back by the police using tear gas and truncheons.[802][264][821] The group returned to the S-Bahn station and made an attempt to reach the stadium from the Pettenkofer Straße instead.[802] They were again blocked by police who immediately used truncheons.[802][820]\n\nRiots broke out at the S-Bahn station.[802] The station building was vandalized and numerous cars were smashed or burned, including at least one W 50 police truck and one police car.[802][264][820][816] The police was allegedly outnumbered.[823][nb 14] Cobblestones were thrown at the police waiting at the Pettenkofer Straße.[802] The police now decided to use their firearms.[802] 18-year old supporter Mike Polley (de) from the locality of Malchow in Berlin was hit by several bullets and instantly killed.[265][807] He was allegedly about to bend down to a friend when hit.[826] Several others were injured and at least another three people were seriously injured.[801][264][821] One supporter of FC Berlin was hit in the head and suffered critical injuries, but survived.[265] The police had fired between 50 and 100 shots in about a minute, from 11 different police pistols.[264][821] Reports and sources vary on what happened on the scene and how the situation was.[264] The police claim that they were surrounded.[823] But this was rebuffed by an eyewitness.[820] Shots had been fired from distances as long as 30–40 meters.[264][820] The police had also fired at fleeing supporters.[820] One supporter was hit while trying to escape into an S-Bahn train.[820] Not every injured had come with the supporters of FC Berlin. Also an uninvolved woman was shot in the leg.[264]\n\nAfter the shootings, some supporters of FC Berlin left the S-Bahn station by train.[823] Many were shaken, but other wanted to take revenge.[820] A group of supporters stopped a tram, kicked the driver out and maneuvered it down town.[265][802] Riots now continued in central Leipzig, where policed presence was low.[820] The riots in central Leipzig continued for several hours and the damage was extensive.[265][802][777] Supporters of FC Berlin devastated entire streets.[823] All shop windows on the Nikolaistraße opposite the main railway station were broken.[816] There was rampage at the Park Hotel.[818][824] The ground floor of a department store on Brühl was destroyed.[824] Numerous cars were demolished and up to 31 shops were smashed and looted.[824][823][264] Supporters clashed with transport police at the main railway station. New shots were fired by the police, but no one was injured.[823][265][264]\n\n\nSupporters of FC Berlin commemorate Mike Polley at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark, during the match against HFC Chemie in the 1990-91 NOFV-Oberliga on 10 November 1990.\nMike Polley was considered a beginner in the supporter scene.[823] A demonstration against police violence with 1,000 participants was arranged in Prenzlauer Berg by supporters of FC Berlin after the match against HFC Chemie on 10 November 1990.[32][264][777] The demonstration was supported by the recently founded Fanprojekt Berlin.[264] Also professional FC Berlin players such as Waldemar Ksienzyk participated in the march.[257] The demonstration received support from politicians such as Lena Schraut from the Alternative List and from left-wing activists, notably from the occupied houses near Senefelderplatz at the Schönhauser Allee.[777][265] The friendly match between East Germany and West Germany that was planned to be held on the Zentralstadion in Leipzig on 21 November 1990 was cancelled for security reasons and due to the tense situation among football supporters after the shootings.[264][777] An investigation against ten police officers was opened, but closed in April 1992.[264][777] The exact circumstances around the death of Mike Polley were never fully clarified.[822][827]\n\nStadium attendance collapsed in 1990. Many supporters of BFC Dynamo stopped attending matches after the Peaceful revolution, as the best players were sold off to clubs in West Germany, sports performance slumped, tickets prices rose, mass unemployment spread and hooligans had come to dominate the stands.[178][801][637][828] Some shifted their focus to ice hockey instead.[829] The average league attendance of the 1990–91 NOFV-Oberliga was by far the lowest in the league history.[801] BFC Dynamo was hit particularly hard by the decline. Average league attendance at BFC Dynamo had dropped from 8,385 in the 1988–89 season to 1,076 in the 1990–91 season.[830][831][832] Ordinary supporters had disappeared. Only young supporters remained in the stadium at FC Berlin in 1990 and 1991.[178]\n\nThe violent faction of FC Berlin would come to shape the entire 1990–91 season.[265] Matches involving FC Berlin were all security matches.[264] A group of 500–600 supporters of FC Berlin travelled with a special train to Rostock for an away match against F.C. Hansa Rostock on 16 March 1991.[265][833] The police did not manage to control the situation despite a record strong presence of more than 600 officers.[833][834] Riots broke out in central Rostock, where supporters smashed shops, demolished cars and attacked people.[265][767][833] Supporters without tickets stormed the Ostseestadion and there were fights with supporters of F.C. Hansa Rostock around the stadium.[833] Riots at the train station after the match had to be suppressed by the police with tear gas and water cannons.[833][265] The damage was again extensive. Up to 17 shops at the Wismarischen Straße were smashed and looted, the train station was devastated and the special train was vandalized.[834] 21 people were injured in the clashes, including nine police officers.[835][836] The damages amounted to around 750,000 Deutsche Marks.[836] The Minister President of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern Alfred Gomolka believed the Stasi was behind the riots. He claimed that the hooligans of FC Berlin were controlled by \"Stasi remnants\" who wanted to cause \"destabilization\". Also the Interior Minister of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern Georg Diederich saw the riots as a political confrontation. As a proof, they pointed to the fact that supporters of FC Berlin came with East German flags and that the club had pre-financed the special train to Rostock.[835]\n\nThe youth television programme Elf99 on Deutscher Fernsehfunk (DFF) ran a special story on the hooligans of FC Berlin in August 1991. The story was called \"Elf-Spezial: Das randalierende Rätsel – Der Berliner Hooligans zwischen Wahn und Scham?\" and can be found on YouTube as of 2020.[837] About 200 supporters of FC Berlin traveled to the top match against Greifswalder SC 1926 in the 1991-92 NOFV-Oberliga Nord on 3 November 1991. Repeated riots broke out during the match. Supporters of FC Berlin claim they were insulted as \"Stasi-pigs!\" by spectators in Greifswald. Supporters of FC Berlin fought with other spectators and the stadium facilities were demolished in the riots.[838] Up to 100 hooligans of FC Berlin also attacked an asylum shelter that was located right next to the stadium in Greifswald.[839][840][788][841] SV Hafen Rostock 61 subsequently postponed its upcoming league match at home against FC Berlin for security reasons.[842][841]\n\nHooliganism\nThe hooligan scene of FC Berlin at the beginning of the 1990s was considered the most notorious for years in Germany. Hooligans of FC Berlin were subsequently involved in numerous fights in stadiums, woods and meadows.[178] Organized fights with other hooligan groups began in 1992 and 1993.[265] However, hooligans of FC Berlin were also involved in fights with squatters and other left-wing groups in the 1990s.[265] 25 supporters of FC Berlin fought 40 people from the left-wing scene in front of a pub on the Straße der Pariser Kommune in Friedrichshain on 17 April 1995. Several people were injured.[843] A number of people allegedly associated with the hooligan scene of FC Berlin attacked formerly occupied houses and a meeting point for left-wing football supporters at Brunnenstraße 6 and 7 in Mitte on the night of 6 September 1997. A punk concert was held on the premises at the time. Four people had to be hospitalized with injuries.[844]\n\nIn the years after German reunification, the club\'s eternal outside image attracted people from the underground.[752] Playing for meager crowds in regional leagues, the club eventually became a meeting place for individuals from Berlin\'s far-right, hooligan and criminal underground.[637][845] By the mid-1990s, the hooligan scene of FC Berlin had developed a connection to the eastern Berlin bouncer scene.[387] The eastern Berlin bouncer scene would eventually be almost completely organized from the hooligan scene of BFC Dynamo.[799][846] One of those involved in the assault on French policeman Daniel Nivel during the 1998 FIFA World Cup had connections to the hooligan scene of FC Berlin.[637] The same man was later linked to organized crime and eventfully involved in a high-profile drug trafficking case.[847][848][637]\n\nThe match between BFC Dynamo and Berlin Türkspor 1965 in the final of the 1998–99 Berlin Cup on 11 May 1999 was marked by violence. Supporters of BFC Dynamo directed far-right chants and others provocations against Berlin Türkspor 1965 during the match.[849] 400 supporters of BFC Dynamo invaded the pitch after the final whistle to celebrate the title. Some supporters also attacked players of Berlin Türkspor 1965. Two players of Berlin Türkspor 1965 were injured, one of them had suffered a stab wound.[850] BFC Dynamo Club President Volkmar Wanski was able to prevent a total escalation by giving a calming speech over the stadium microphone.[851] He immediately apologized for the behavior of the supporters at the press conference after the match.[850] Older supporters of BFC Dynamo openly expressed their contempt for the far-right supporters that had visited the match.[852] BFC Dynamo and Berlin Türkspor 1965 agreed to meet in a friendly match later in the season and to organize a joint meal for players and responsible.[853] Wanski made it clear in the speakers ahead of the last home match against FC Rot-Weiß Erfurt in the 1998-99 Regionalliga Nordost on 15 May 1999 that \"anyone who cannot behave has no business in our stadium\".[854]\n\nSerious riots broke out in Prenzlauer Berg after the match between BFC Dynamo and 1. FC Union Berlin in the Round of 16 of the 2000–01 Berlin Cup at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark on 24 March 2001. Around 150 supporters of BFC Dynamo attacked the police after the match, as they wanted to storm the block of Union Berlin.[855][342] Around 500 supporters of BFC Dynamo then attacked police at Eberswalder Straße.[342] The police employed water cannons against supporters at Eberswalder Straße and Schönhauser Allee. Nine people, including four police officers, were injured.[855][342] BFC Dynamo Club President Karin Halsch (de) and 1. FC Union Berlin Club President Heiner Bertram criticized the police in unison for provocations during the match and for triggering riots.[341] Karin Halsch simultaneously expressed sadness that the riots destroyed a lot of reconstruction work in the club and announced that there would be many stadium bans.[341][856] Also coach Jürgen Bogs spoke out about \"senseless violence\" that would once again fall back on the club, but also criticized the police for provocations.[341] Many of those involved in the riots did not come from the supporter scene of BFC Dynamo. Many were visitors from other cities in Germany.[387]\n\nBFC Dynamo had the highest number of violent supporters in Germany in 2005.[857] Violence broke out during the match between Tennis Borussia Berlin and BFC Dynamo in the 2004-05 NOFV-Oberliga Nord at the Mommsenstadion on 11 February 2005. A flare was lit and a couple of bangers set off in the guest block at the beginning of the second half. Police then decided to intervene against away supporters. Police officers were pelted with beer cups and attacked by supporters of BFC Dynamo when they entered gest block. Eight police officers were injured and 11 supporters of BFC Dynamo arrested. BFC Dynamo criticized the police operation as \"disproportionate\".[858][431] Supporters of BFC Dynamo claimed that they had been called \"Nazis\", \"Ossis\" and \"Unioners\" by police officers. Riots had broken out also when Tennis Borussia Berlin played 1. FC Union Berlin in round of 16 of the 2004-05 Berlin Cup at the Mommsenstadion a couple of weeks before.[431]\n\nFighting between supporters of BFC Dynamo and police again broke out in connection with the match between BFC Dynamo and SV Yeşilyurt at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark on 24 April 2005. The mood had been tense during the match. The situation escalated when celebrating supporters of BFC Dynamo attacked the fence after the final whistle. Police intervened with water hoses, batons and tear gas against supporters of BFC Dynamo. Four police officers were injured and five hooligans arrested. One police officer suffered a broken nose and another one a concussion.[859][860] Riots again broke out in connection to a match between BFC Dynamo and SV Yeşilyurt at the opening of the 2005-06 NOFV-Oberliga Nord at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark 5 August 2005. The match was attended by 1,200 supporters of BFC Dynamo. Hooligans in the crowd threw bottles and stones at police officers during the match. Fights between hooligans and police then broke out after match. Around 150 hooligans had participated in the riots, according to police information.[861][438] BFC Dynamo spokesperson Yiannis Kaufmann claimed that those involved were a \"mob of travelling fans who wants to cause trouble everywhere and now discredit the BFC\".[861] As many as 13 police officers were injured in the riots.[439][440]\n\n\nThe Stadion im Sportforum on 14 May 2006.\nPolice made a controversial raid against the discotheque Jeton in Friedrichshain where supporters of BFC Dynamo and other people had gathered to celebrate in connection to a fan tournament in memory of Mike Polley on the night of 20 August 2005. The fan tournament had been visited by numerous teams, including teams from FC St. Pauli, 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig, Aberdeen F.C., VfL Bochum and Malmö FF.[862][863][864] The large-scale police operation involved 300 officers, including 100 members of the SEK.[865][866][867] 158 persons were arrested. Among the detainees were 19 Category C-supporters and 22 Category B-supporters.[439][866] Supporters filed numerous complaints against the police for use of excessive violence.[868] 39 people at the discotheque were injured.[440] Also bystanders were affected.[440] Police initially claimed they had been pelted with bottles and furnishings, but later corrected their statement and admitted that there had been no resistance.[865][440][439] The police had allegedly beaten defenseless people.[869] Police stated that the raid was a preventative measure on short notice to prevent hooligans from organizing for the upcoming match against Union Berlin on 21 August 2005.[440][866] There were speculations that police also took revenge for riots during the match between BFC Dynamo and SV Yeşilyurt at the opening of the season.[440][439] More than 1,000 police officers were deployed to the derby and the match was played without crowd trouble.[866][867] Banners in solidarity with the supporters of BFC Dynamo were displayed in 17 football stadiums across Germany during the following matchdays.[870]\n\nThe return match between BFC Dynamo and Union Berlin in the 2005–06 NOFV-Oberliga Nord was played at the Stadion im Sportforum on 13 May 2006. The standing was 1–1 when supporters of BFC Dynamo invaded the pitch in an attempt to storm the block of Union Berlin around the 75th minute.[871] Supporters of Union Berlin fled in panic.[872] The match was abandoned and Union Berlin was awarded a 2–0 win.[871][873] The players of BFC Dynamo wore the motto \"No power of violence\" on their shirts in the following match against BFC Preussen away on 17 May 2006.[874] The Stadion im Sportforum was temporarily closed for matches in the NOFV-Oberliga Nord after the riots.[457] The riots during the match against 1. FC Union Berlin threw the club into a financial crisis. Treasurer Sven Radicke concluded: \"Four years of our work were ruined in five minutes\".[459]\n\nBFC Dynamo has often attracted hooligans from outside, and hooligans who are otherwise not involved in the supporter scene, to high-profile matches.[520][875][530] The club has repeatedly complained about so-called \"riot tourists\".[530][876] Riots broke out after the match against Berliner AK 07 in the final of the 2009–10 Berlin Cup at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark on 2 June 2010. Around 100–150 supporters of BFC Dynamo attempted to invade the pitch after the final whistle.[519][875] Match stewards and players of BFC Dynamo threw themselves in to restrain supporters and prevent further riots.[519][877][875][520] One of them was goalkeeper Nico Thomaschewski, who later received an award from the Berlin Football Association (BFV) for his actions.[875] Polish fans of Pogoń Szczecin were allegedly linked to the riots.[875] Those who had invaded the pitch were whistled by other supporters of BFC Dynamo when they returned to the stands.[878]\n\nMajor riots then occurred after the match against 1. FC Kaiserslautern in the first round of the 2011-12 DFB-Pokal at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark on 3 July 2011.[528][529] Around 200–300 supporters of BFC Dynamo invaded the buffer zone and stormed the guest block after the match.[530][520] 18 police officers and many supporters from Kaiserslautern were injured in the attack.[520] The Chairman of the Economic Council Peter Meyer openly expressed his embarrassment and disappointment over the behavior of some supporters and publicly apologized.[530] There were allegations that hooligans outside the BFC Dynamo environment had been involved.[530] While the police stated that most of those arrested were from Berlin, the club claimed it had never seen most of the recent perpetrators before.[520]\n\nThe contemporary supporter scene\nThe contemporary supporter scene contains various subcultures and categories of supporters. It ranges from older supporters to younger ultras.[749] Older supporters constitute an essential part of the supporter scene.[752] Many are active in the supporter group 79er.[875] The group is credited for its commitment to the club, notably the youth teams. Its members have been supporters of BFC Dynamo since the late 1970s.[875][717]\n\nThe supporter scene played an important part in saving the club from bankruptcy in 2001.[637] Supporters organized a demonstration against the impending bankruptcy. The demonstration marched from the Sportforum to the Rotes Rathaus where it was met by the former club president and SPD politician Karin Halsch.[368][369] Supporters threw parties and organized collections, made donations and travelled to countries such as Austria and Switzerland to convince creditors to accept smaller pay-offs in order to save the cub.[637] Supporters also installed bucket seats at the Stadion im Sportforum and built a new clubhouse in the Sportforum during the insolvency.[729][879] The insolvency crisis remains a defining moment for older supporters.[637] The supporter scene has traditionally arranged an annual Mike-Polley-Gedenkturnier, which is a football fan tournament in memory of Mike Polley.[822][880] The first edition of the fan tournament was arranged in the Sportforum Hohenschönhausen in 2003 and comprised 28 teams.[881] A march in memory of Mike Polley in Leipzig in 2018 was attended by 850 supporters of BFC Dynamo.[882]\n\nNew groups of younger ultra-oriented supporters have emerged since the 2000s.[875][717] Supporter group Fraktion H was founded in 2006 by younger supporters who wanted to create more atmosphere in the stadium.[875][717] A minor ultras scene then emerged with the founding of supporter group Ultras BFC in 2011. The ultras of BFC Dynamo have initiated campaigns such as \"Brown is not Claret\" and have also engaged in football tournaments for refugees.[845][717][883][608] The club has encouraged the new groups of younger supporters and club management has taken a stand against racism and right-wing extremism.[884][883][608] Fraktion H maintains a friendship with the supporters of Eintracht Trier, while members of the now dissolved Ultras BFC have had contacts with the ultras of Swedish football club GAIS.[885]\n\nBFC Dynamo is affiliated with Fanprojekt Berlin, which is an independent organization that engages in socio-pedagogical fan work.[752][886] The organization supports young fans in various aspects of life and aims at promoting a positive supporter culture.[886] BFC Dynamo engages in active fan work and has taken measures to control violent elements, to exclude known violators and to distance itself from radical supporters.[752][530][883] Far-right symbols and slogans are not tolerated by the club.[752] The Chairman of the Economic Council, Peter Meyer, stated publicly in connection with a friendly match against Hertha BSC in 2007 that the club did not want people who cannot follow the rules and that \"anyone who shouts Nazi slogans will be thrown out of the stadium\".[495] Lawyer and former Vice President of BFC Dynamo René Lau said in an interview with Deutsche Welle in 2019: \"If you had asked me 25 years ago [if BFC had a problem with Nazis], I would have said yes. But is today\'s BFC Dynamo a Nazi club? I would vehemently dispute that.\"[637] A large number of stadium bans has been issued by the club since the mid-2000s.[887][530] A total of 40 stadium bans was issued only in 2006.[888][887] No riots has occurred since 2011.[752]\n\nThe contemporary supporter scene has includes groups such as 79er, Mythos BFC, Fraktion H, Piefkes, Ultras BFC, East Company, Riot Sport, Black Boys Dynamo, Bärenbande, Gegengerade, Hipstercrew, Märkische Jungs, Sektion Süddeutschland and Banda Invicta.[875][889][717][890] Supporter group Gegengerade is a left wing-oriented fan club.[890] A number of supporters BFC Dynamo had been members of the \"Anti-Fascist Football Fan Initiative\" (AFFI) aleady back in 1993.[891][892] Supporters of BFC Dynamo have occasionally displayed a Norwegian flag with the text \"Thanks Norway\", in memory of Norway\'s 2–0 win over Nazi Germany in the quarter-finals of the 1936 Summer Olympics. Another banner that has occasionally been displayed at the stadium contains the text \"There Is A Light That Never Goes Out\", with reference to the 1980s British cult band The Smiths.[893]\n\nUltras BFC announced its dissolution on 23 January 2023, after the group had lost essential material in an attack. An individual in the group was attacked by a group of people in front of his private residence and robbed of essential group material. The group apologized to the supporter scene of BFC Dynamo and consequently dissolved, but at the same time announced that this was not the end.[894] The attack has been traced to Cottbus.[895] A new supporter group named Banda Invicta eventually presented itself with a banner and a coreography on the first matchday of the 2023-24 Regionalliga Nordost on 29 July 2023. The coreography read \"On to a new chapter\".[896]\n\nBFC Dynamo had 100 Category C and 190 Category-B supporters in 2019.[897] Younger hooligans of BFC Dynamo have contacts with supporter group Kaliber 030 at Hertha.[637][898] 20–25 supporters of BFC Dynamo joined Hertha in the guest block of the Stadion an der Alten Försterei during the derby between Union Berlin and Hertha on 2 November 2019.[899] Older hooligans of BFC Dynamo, on the other hand, maintain friendly relationships with like-minded supporters of 1. FC Magdeburg.[637] Supporters of BFC Dynamo wanted to travel in numbers to the return leg against VfB Oldenburg in the promotion play-offs for the 3. Liga on 4 June 2022. Up to 2,500 supporters of BFC Dynamo wanted to join the team in Oldenburg.[900] Around 1,300 supporters of BFC Dynamo was eventually admitted to the Marschweg-Stadion, where they marked their presence with a banner, a scarf choreography and flares.[901][902][903]\n\nOne of the most well-known books in Germany about the supporter scene of BFC Dynamo is \"Der BFC war schuld am Mauerbau\" by German author Andreas Gläser (de). The book was first published in 2002 and describes the supporter scene from the late 1970s and forward. The club, its reputation and supporter scene, was also the theme of stage play \"Dynamoland\" by Gudrun Herrbold. The play was set up in 2007 and involved young football players from BFC Dynamo as well as Andreas Gläser.[784][520][904] The fanzine \"Zugriff\" is dedicated to BFC Dynamo. The fanzine has been produced by Andreas Gläser and members of supporter group Gegengerade since 2008.[905] The tenth and latest issue was published in 2014. The tenth issue came with as music CD mixed by Andreas Gläser. The CD included numerous ska and punk tracks as well as a 25 seconds long recording of Erich Mielke ranting about skinheads and punks.[749]\n\nMusicians from German rock band Klaus Renft Combo composed the anthem \"Auf, Dynamo!\" for BFC Dynamo in 1999.[906] German rap musician Joe Rilla has also dedicated a song to BFC Dynamo. The song is called \"Heb die Faust Hoch (BFC Dynamo Straßenhymne)\" and was released in 2008. Joe Rilla, whose real name is Hagen Stoll (de), has a background in the hooligan scene of BFC Dynamo.[907] The clothing store Hoolywood on Schönhauser Allee in Prenzlauer Berg is associated with the supporter scene of BFC Dynamo. The store was founded at the beginning of the 1990s.[752][904][908] The store has been an advertising partner of BFC Dynamo.[909]\n\nRivalries\nSG Dynamo Dresden\nThe oldest rival of BFC Dynamo is SG Dynamo Dresden. The rivalry dates back to 1954 when the team of Dynamo Dresden and its place in the DDR-Oberliga was transferred to SC Dynamo Berlin during the course of the 1954-55 season. The relocation aroused a sense of victimhood among the fans of Dynamo Dresden which would later be compounded by the successes of BFC Dynamo.[758] Matters were exacerbated when additional players of Dynamo Dresden were delegated to Dynamo Berlin by the German Football Association of the GDR (DFV) following the relegation of Dynamo Dresden after the 1962–63 season.[910] The antagonism between the two clubs was underpinned by a historical German rivalry between Prussian Berlin and Saxony.[719][911] It was fueled by contemporary resentment in Dresden at the better provision of housing and consumer goods in the East German capital.[719] East Berliners were generally unpopular outside the city limits, especially in the southern regional districts of East Germany. They were considered arrogant and clearly preferred.[751]\n\nDynamo Dresden slowly recovered from the relocation. The club was declared a regional district center of excellence (German: Leistungszentrum) by the regional district board of the DTSB on 5 August 1968.[912][913] The club could now draw on the best players in Bezirk Dresden.[912] Dynamo Dresden eventually re-established itself in the DDR-Oberliga and became campions once again in the 1970-71 DDR-Oberliga. BFC Dynamo and Dynamo Dresden then met in the final of the 1970-71 FDGB-Pokal. Klaus Sammer scored 1-0 for Dynamo Dresden, but Norbert Johannsen equalized on a penalty. Dynamo Dresden eventually won the match 2-1 after a second goal by Sammer in extra time.[57] Dynamo Dresden thus secured the first Double in the history of East German football.[914] However, BFC Dynamo did not go completely empty-handed from the final. The team qualified for its first UEFA competition as runners-up. Its participation in the 1971–72 European Cup Winners\' Cup would be a success.\n\n\nA duel between Harald Schütze (left) and Reinhard Häfner of Dynamo Dresden (right) during a match between BFC Dynamo and Dynamo Dresden in the DDR-Oberliga in 1976.\nBFC Dynamo met Dynamo Dresden away on the sixth matchday of the 1974-75 DDR-Oberliga on 21 September 1974. The standing was 2–2 at the end of the match, after an equalizer from Norbert Johannsen on a penalty. Shortly before the final whistle, referee Robert Pischke from Rostock awarded Dynamo Dresden a controversial penalty. Siegmar Wätzlich converted the penalty and Dynamo Dresden won the match 3–2.[915][916] The East German football weekly Die neue Fußballwoche (FuWo) commented: \"Shortly before the end, the same thing on the other side, but this one surprised even the objective Dresdeners about it. They hadn\'t seen any opposing influence on the falling Richter... The Berliners exploded in outrage at the penalty kick, which snatched a point from them in the last minute.\"[916] Dynamo Dresden finished the season in third place, two points ahead of BFC Dynamo. BFC Dynamo finished the season in fourth place, but with a better goal difference. Dynamo Dresden had thus captured the place in the 1975-76 UEFA Cup narrowly ahead of BFC Dynamo. Referee Pischke was not selected for any more DDR-Oberliga matches and eventually chose to end his refereeing career.[917] He would years later become the president of F.C. Hansa Rostock.[918]\n\nDynamo Dresden would come to dominate East German football in the 1970s. The team managed to capture a third consecutive league title in the 1977–78 DDR-Oberliga. What happened after is subject to various rumors. Formal title celebrations took place in June 1978 at the hotel and restaurant Bastein at Prager Straße in Dresden. Erich Mielke paid a visit as the president of SV Dynamo to congratulate the team to the title. Dynamo Dresden player Reinhard Häfner recalls how Mielke held a speech where he said that he would be happier if BFC Dynamo was champions. Mielke should have added that \"since BFC Dynamo is also SV Dynamo, the title stays in the family, so to speak, and that is good too\". According to other versions of the same event, he allegedly proclaimed that everything will be done so that in the coming year, the champion will come from Berlin, and that it was now the turn of the BFC Dynamo.[919][920][921][922][nb 15]\n\n\nThomas Doll and defending Matthias Döschner of Dynamo Dresden during a match between Dynamo Dresden and BFC Dynamo in 1987.\nBFC Dynamo stood out among other clubs within SV Dynamo. The club was located at the frontline of the Cold War. It was also a representative of the capital of East Germany. This meant that the club had to be well equipped.[67] BFC Dynamo would come to benefit from a nationwide scouting system, supported by 33 training centers (TZ) of SV Dynamo across East Germany.[68][927] No less than 40 full-time trainers worked for the club.[928] The team embarked on a period of unparalleled success in the 1978–79 season under young coach Jürgen Bogs. Dynamo Dresden had been the dominant team in East German football until then. BFC Dynamo would now be its main obstacle to success.[nb 16]\n\nBFC Dynamo opened the 1978-79 DDR-Oberliga with ten consecutive wins. The team thus broke the previous record of Dynamo Dresden of seven consecutive wins from the 1972-73 DDR-Oberliga. Dynamo Dresden, on the other hand, had a moderately successful start to the season and stood in second place. The two teams met in the 11th matchday in front of 33,000 spectators at Dynamo-Stadion in Dresden on 2 December 1978.[934] The match ended in a draw 1-1 after an equalizer by Hans-Jürgen Riediger for BFC Dynamo. The match was marked by crowd trouble, with 38 fans to both teams arrested.[4] 17 of the 38 fans arrested were fans of BFC Dynamo.[935] Inexperienced linesman Günter Supp should allegedly have missed an offside position on Riediger in the situation leading up to the equalizer.[936][937] There were accusations in Dresden that the match had been manipulated by the referees in favor of BFC Dynamo.[4][180][201] This alleged manipulation was cited as yet another example of discrimination against the Saxon city in comparison with East Berlin.[4][180] BFC Dynamo continued to lead the league for the rest of the season. The team finally secured its first DDR-Oberliga title after defeating Dynamo Dresden 3–1 in the 24th match day in front of 22,000 spectators at Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark on 6 June 1979.[938]\n\nThe 1979-80 DDR-Oberliga would be tight race between the two rivals. Dynamo Dresden led the league for most of the season. Dynamo Dresden was still in first place before the last matchday. However, BFC Dynamo was only one point behind. The two rivals met at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark in the last matchday of the league season on 10 May 1980. Dynamo Dresden only needed a draw to win the league title. There was huge excitement around the match and the stadium was sold out. Die neue Fußballwoche (FuWo) reported on \"international match atmosphere\".[939] The standing was 0-0 for a long time. Dynamo Dresden player Peter Kotte fell in the BFC Dynamo penalty area with about 15 minutes left of regular time, but Dynamo Dresden was denied a penalty.[940] Norbert Trieloff instead scored a goal for BFC Dynamo just a moment later. BFC Dynamo eventually won the match 1-0 and captured its second consecutive league title in front of 30,000 spectators. Dynamo Dresden would not come this close to BFC Dynamo in the league until the end of the 1980s. It was rumoured that referee Hans Kulicke from Oderberg had favored BFC Dynamo. However, also BFC Dynamo had been denied a chance to decide the match. A goal by Hartmut Pelka had been disallowed by referee Kulicke due to a foul on Dynamo Dresden goalkeeper Bernd Jakubowski.[921]\n\nBoth clubs were affiliated to SV Dynamo and supported by the security organs. However, BFC Dynamo was more associated with the Stasi, while Dynamo Dresden was more associated with the Volkspolizei.[941] BFC Dynamo was known as the favourite club of the head of the Stasi Erich Mielke.[942] Dynamo Dresden, on the other hand, was patronaged by Volkspolizei Lieutenant general Willi Nyffenegger. Nyffenegger was the long-time head of the regional district authority of the Volkspolizei in Bezirk Dresden.[943] However, also Dynamo Dresden had supporters in the Stasi. The Stasi had helped Dynamo Dresden to obtain secret information about the line-up of FC Bayern Munich before the match between Dynamo Dresden and FC Bayern Munich in the 1973–74 European Cup on 7 November 1973.[944] Dynamo Dresden would also be supported by Stasi Major general Horst Böhm in the 1980s.[945] Böhm was the head of the regional district administration of the Stasi in Bezirk Dresden.[946][947][758] He was a committed local patriot when it came to Dynamo Dresden and a sponsoring member of the club.[948][947][949] The antagonism between the two clubs also spread to the Stasi Guards Regiment \"Felix E. Dzerzhinsky\".[719][4] The behavior of members of a Dresden unit during a match between the two teams in 1985 was likened to that of \"rioting fans\" by another Stasi officer.[719] Some Stasi guards had hurled abuse at BFC Dynamo players, shouting \"Bent champions!\" as they left the pitch.[758]\n\nResentment in Dresden over the rise of BFC Dynamo was worsened when three top players of Dynamo Dresden, Gerd Weber, Peter Kotte and Matthias Müller, were arrested on suspicion of planning to defect to West Germany in 1981.[950][4] Weber had solicited plans to defect, but the other two had not.[951] Weber received a prison sentence and a lifetime ban from playing football at any level in East Germany, while Kotte and Müller received lifetime bans from playing in the top two tiers for alleged complicity.[950][4][952] Neither would return to the Oberliga. The punishment against the three players led to rumors and protests in Dresden.[950] They also fueled local patriotism and anti-Berlin sentiments in Dresden.[950]\n\nFans of Dynamo Dresden saw the lifetime bans on Weber, Kotte and Müller as \"an order from Erich Mielke\" designed to weaken Dynamo Dresden.[950] Also, Kotte and Klaus Sammer has claimed they were part of a delibate plan by Mielke to weaken Dynamo Dresden.[953][954] However, such claims are doubtful.[953] The three players had been reported by an unofficial collaborator (IM) and Mielke was convinced that all three were originally prepared to defect.[951][953] Kotte was not an isolated case. The great fear of footballers, fans and officials who had fled East Germany was omnipresent at the Stasi.[955] Kotte and Müller knew about the intentions of Weber.[950] Their failure to inform authorities was critical.[950] Former SED First Secretary in Bezik Dresden Hans Modrow concludes that the measures against the three were \"generally cautious\", given the completely different consequences for other East German citizens in similar contexts. After all, the three were also members of the armed organs (German: Bewaffnete Organe der DDR) with ranks.[956] Müller said in an interview with Dresdner Neueste Nachrichten in 2011 that he \"knew one hundred percent\" that the uncompromising actions against the three players were a deliberate attempt by the Stasi to weaken Dynamo Dresden in order to secure the supremacy of BFC Dynamo.[957]\n\n\nBFC Dynamo midfielder Bernd Schulz celebrates a goal against Dynamo Dresden in the DFV-Supercup together with Thomas Doll (left) and Jörg Fügner (right) in 1989.\nBFC Dynamo and Dynamo Dresden would be the two main contenders for titles in East German football during the 1980s. BFC Dynamo dominated the DDR-Oberliga and won consecutive titles, while Dynamo Dresden had major success in the FDGB-Pokal. The two teams met in the 1981-82 FDGB-Pokal and 1983-84 FDGB-Pokal final. Dynamo Dresden won both finals and thus stopped BFC Dynamo from completing the Double.[940] The teams then also met in the 1984-85 FDGB-Pokal final. The performance of the referees in the final was controversial. A review by the DFV found that 30 percent of the referee decisions during the match had been wrong, and that 80 percent of those had been of disadvantage to Dynamo Dresden.[958] Referee Manfred Roßner was banned one year from officiating matches above second tier after the final.[959][960][958] However, nothing emerged that indicated that Roßner had been bought by the Stasi.[961] Dynamo Dresden won the final 3–2 in front of 48,000 spectators at the Stadion der Weltjugend. It was the fourth loss for BFC Dynamo against Dynamo Dresden in the final of the FDGB-Pokal and the third time that Dynamo Dresden had stopped the team from completing the Double.[940] However, BFC Dynamo would eventually succeed in completing the Double in the 1987–88 season, defeating FC Carl Zeiss Jena 2–0 in final of the 1987–88 FDGB-Pokal.\n\nDisturbances by spectators was a regular occurrence at matches between the two teams.[758] BFC Dynamo was met by immense hostility during away matches in Dresden. Fans of BFC Dynamo would respond to the hatred they met by singing chants in praise of Erich Mielke as a provocation.[758][178] They also made fun of the food shortage in Dresden.[753] Fans of BFC Dynamo are known to have brought coveted tropical fruits, that were only available in East Berlin, to away matches in Saxony. The fruits were then thrown at the home crowd.[178][753][751][nb 17] In Dresden they threw green bananas at the home fans and shouted: \"We brought you something - Bananas, bananas!\".[753] East German state television would always try to hide riots from viewers and sound engineers also had to drown out chants that were considered negative, such as \"Stasi out\". The match between BFC Dynamo and SG Dynamo Dresden was the most explosive encounter. At one point, the match between BFC Dynamo and SG Dynamo Dresden was even ordered to be recorded completely without sound.[776] A group of about 250 hooligans of Dynamo Dresden chanted anti-Semitic slogans against BFC Dynamo, such as \"Berlin Jews!\" and \"Jews\' sow!, during the match between the two teams in the 1987-88 DDR-Oberliga in East Berlin on 6 April 1988.[792][963] A number of supporters of SG Dynamo Dresden were then allegedly arrested after the match.[963]\n\nBFC Dynamo\'s ten-year dominance in the league was eventually broken by Dynamo Dresden in the 1988–89 season. BFC Dynamo won a second consecutive cup title in the 1988-89 FDGB-Pokal, but Dynamo Dresden became the new champion in the 1988-89 DDR-Oberliga. BFC Dynamo and Dynamo Dresden then met in the first ever DFV-Supercup in 1989. BFC Dynamo won the match 4–1 in front of 22,347 spectators at the Stadion der Freundschaft in Cottbus and became the first and only winner of the DFV-Supercup in the history of East German football.\n\nBFC Dynamo and Dynamo Dresden met 60 times in the Oberliga, FDGB-Pokal and DFV-Supercup between 1966 and 1991. BFC Dynamo won 21 matches and Dynamo Dresden won 27 matches. BFC Dynamo and Dynamo Dresden also met 10 times in the Regionalliga Nordost between 1995 and 2000. BFC Dynamo won 3 matches and Dynamo Dresden won 5 matches. The last meeting ended 1–1 and took place in the 1999-00 Regionalliga Nordost on 26 April 2000. The two teams rarely meet these days, because Dynamo Dresden regularly appears in the second or third tier of the German football league system. Former Dynamo Dresden player Ralf Minge expressed in an interview in 2018 his satisfaction that Dynamo Dresden has advanced past BFC Dynamo, but also said that he would not mind new duels with BFC Dynamo and that duels with BFC Dynamo \"have a certain charm\".[964]\n\n1. FC Union Berlin\nFurther information: Berlin derby\nBFC Dynamo and 1. FC Union Berlin were founded only a few days apart. Both clubs were formed during the reorganization of East German football in December 1965 and January 1966, when the football departments of ten sports clubs (SC) were reorganized into dedicated football clubs.[965] However, Union Berlin was not part of the original plan. Two football clubs had already been planned for East Berlin. They were to be formed from the football departments of SC Dynamo Berlin and ASK Vorwärts Berlin.[64] In addition, TSC Berlin played only in the second tier DDR-Liga at the time.[965][64] The founding of Union Berlin probably owed much to the intervention of the powerful Herbert Warnke.[965][762][966] Herbert Warnke was the chairman of the national state trade union FDGB and a member of the SED Politburo.[965] Dynamo Berlin and Vorwärts Berlin were both associated with the armed and security organs.[965][64] Herbert Warnke therefore argued for the formation of a civilian club for the working people of East Berlin.[965][64] He would be a passionate fan of Union Berlin.[967] Another high-ranking SED politician who pushed for the founding a civilian football club in East Berlin was the SED First Secretary in East Berlin and SED Politburo member Paul Verner.[968] Verner held a speech at the founding ceremony of Union Berlin.[969]\n\nBoth BFC Dynamo and Union Berlin belonged to the elite in East German football.[762][970] The new football clubs were intended as centers of excellence, with the right to draw on talents within designated geographical areas.[4][64] BFC Dynamo was supported by the Stasi, while Union Berlin was supported by the FDGB.[971][972][nb 18] However, Union Berlin was able to trace its origins back to FC Olympia Oberschöneweide in 1906.[753] BFC Dynamo had no history before East Germany. The supporters of Union Berlin therefore considered their club to be a genuine football club, unlike BFC Dynamo.[762] However, even as a civilian club, Union Berlin was also part of the sports political system.[177][975][65] The founding of the Union Berlin was organized by the then SED First Secretary in Köpenick Hans Modrow.[976] Like Herbert Warnke, Hans Modrow would be a sponsoring member of the club.[971][976] The most important positions on the board of Union Berlin were exclusively held by directors of state-owned factories or SED representatives.[65] Union Berlin was state-funded and all decisions in club had to be reported to the all-powerful central sports agency DTSB.[975] The DTSB stood in turn under direct control of the SED Central Committee.[977]\n\nThe rivalry between BFC Dynamo and Union Berlin began in the mid-1960s. It was initially based on the geographical proximity to each other.[66] BFC Dynamo and Union Berlin were two clubs from East Berlin in the DDR-Oberliga.[66] BFC Dynamo struggled in the 1966-67 DDR-Oberliga and was threatened with relegation. The feud between the two clubs began when fans of Union Berlin mocked BFC Dynamo with a banner saying \"We greet the relegated\" during a league match at the Stadion an der Alten Försterei on 26 April 1967.[45][972] Union Berlin won the match by 3–0 and BFC Dynamo was eventually relegated to the DDR-Liga at the end of the season.[45] While BFC Dynamo was playing in the second tier DDR-Liga, Union Berlin surprisingly won the 1967–68 FDGB-Pokal.[762] However, BFC Dynamo immediately bounced back and managed to establish itself in the DDR-Oberliga. Union Berlin would then itself be relegated to the DDR-Liga after the 1968-69 DDR-Oberliga, but also managed to return to the DDR-Oberliga after just one season in the second tier. Union Berlin would be the stronger of the two teams until the 1970s.[978]\n\nThe rivalry between the two clubs intensified in the early 1970s.[66] The player of Union Berlin, Klaus Korn, was suspended after a heated derby in the 1970–71 DDR-Oberliga at the Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum on 28 October 1970.[66][45] The performance of the referees had been \"catastrophic\" according to private notes from the then Second Club Secretary and Vice President of Union Berlin Günter Mielis, and the match ended with riots.[66][979][980] Klaus Korn had insulted players in BFC Dynamo with slurs such as \"Stasi-pig\". The DFV Legal Commission imposed a one-year ban on Klaus Korn after a circumstantial trial.[981][982] The DFV Legal Commission also demanded that Union Berlin considered his exclusion from the club. Klaus Korn was then excluded from the club and would never play in the DDR-Oberliga again.[981][982][66][45] Unrest broke out again at a derby in Hohenschönhausen one year later. Eight spectators were arrested after the match between BFC Dynamo and Union Berlin in the 1971–72 DDR-Oberliga at the Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum on 28 December 1971.[983] The match was attended by 14,000 spectators and the stadium was sold out.[984][712]\n\nThe football landscape in East Berlin changed before the 1971–72 season. Vorwärts Berlin was relocated to Frankfurt an der Oder on 31 July 1971. BFC Dynamo and Union Berlin were from now on the only major football clubs in East Berlin.[985] The relocation meant that BFC Dynamo could now take over the role of the dominant team for the armed organs in East Berlin. The team would also have opportunity to eventually move into the larger and more centrally located Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark, which led to increased interest in the club and growing attendance numbers.[66] The districts in East Berlin had previously been divided between BFC Dynamo, Vorwärts Berlin and Union Berlin. Each club was able to recruit young players from training centers (TZ) in their districts.[64][65] All training centers that had previously belonged to Vorwärts Berlin were now given to BFC Dynamo.[64][65] The DTSB allegedly saw more potential in BFC Dynamo.[64] BFC Dynamo now had access to two thirds of all training centers (TZ) in East Berlin.[65][35] This meant that BFC Dynamo had gained a much stronger position in East Berlin than Union Berlin when it came to recruiting young players.[978] FC Vorwärts Frankfurt was given Bezirk Potsdam as a catchment area, in addition to Bezirk Frankfurt. Bezirk Potsdam had previously been assigned to Union Berlin and thus had to be handed over to Vorwärts Frankfurt. This further weakened Union Berlin in relation to BFC Dynamo.[986][65][nb 19]\n\nUnion Berlin was relegated to the DDR-Liga after the 1972–73 season. The Union Berlin star and national team player Reinhard Lauck was transferred to BFC Dynamo after the relegation.[987] The loss of Lauck was a hard blow for the team. Lauck had contributed greatly to the victory in the final of the 1967–68 FDGB-Pokal and was well-liked among the supporters of Union Berlin.[987] Supporters of Union Berlin are said to have gathered outside his apartment, to appeal to him to stay in the team and play in the second tier.[988][989] But Lauck had already decided to change team.[988][990] The DFV had allegedly advised him to switch to BFC Dynamo in order to continue playing in the national team.[987] According to a regulation in the 1970 DFV Football Resolution (German: DFV-Fußballbeschluss), national team players in clubs that had been relegated from the DDR-Oberliga should switch clubs in order to remain competitive.[991] Lauck would make a successful appearance for East Germany in the 1974 FIFA World Cup and would win gold with East Germany in the 1976 Summer Olympics.[987][989] Lauck became the team captain of BFC Dynamo in the 1974–75 season.[82] He would later win two league titles with BFC Dynamo before ending his career due to a knee injury.[989][992]\n\nUnion Berlin would remain in the DDR-Liga for several seasons. Instead of playing matches against BFC Dynamo in the DDR-Oberliga, the team was now left to compete with the reserve team of BFC Dynamo, the BFC Dynamo II. Union Berlin would also suffer more blows which further weakened its position in relation to BFC Dynamo. Herbert Warnke passed in 1975 and was replaced as chairman of the FDGB by Harry Tisch.[971] Harry Tisch had begun his political career in Rostock and chose instead to give the support of the FDGB to F.C. Hansa Rostock.[971] Union Berlin thus lost the support of the FDGB and also no longer had any support in the top of the political hierarchy.[993] From no on, the club could only rely on support from the district administration of the SED in East Berlin and local state-owned enterprises, such as VEB Kabelwerk Oberspree (KWO) and VEB Transformatorenwerk Oberschöneweide (TRO).[994][971]\n\nThe DTSB and the DFV had also continued their efforts to concentrate resources on a few clubs during the 1970s.[995] A number of football clubs became specially promoted focus clubs in the 1970 DFV Football Resolution.[60][996] The focus clubs were meant to be strengthened through player transfers. Players in teams that had been relegated from the DDR-Oberliga should also switch to focus clubs.[997] The focus clubs were also equipped with more staff as well as better material and technical conditions.[998][60][996] BFC Dynamo became the focus club in East Berlin.[999][1000][995][nb 20] Even more advantages were then given to the focus clubs in the 1976 DFV Football Resolution. The focus clubs would now be allowed to delegate youth players from other football clubs. They would also be provided with more youth coaches from the DFV and have the right to accommodate twice as many students in their affiliated Children and Youth Sports Schools (KJS) every year, compared to other football clubs.[1001][999][1002] Union Berlin would now have to delegate some of its best young players to BFC Dynamo.[978][nb 21] One example was the talented Detlef Helms, who was delegated to BFC Dynamo as a 17-year-old in 1977.[65][970]\n\nUnion Berlin returned to the Oberliga in the 1976–77 season. Stadion an der Alten Försterei was a small football stadium without cinder tracks where the crowd stood close to the pitch.[762][990] Union Berlin had become the focus of hooligan attention.[719] Matches at the Stadion an der Alten Föresterei had regularly been interrupted by spectators throwing objects on the pitch.[1003] The derby between BFC Dynamo and Union Berlin was now such as heated affair that the matches were moved by the DFV to the neutral Stadion der Weltjugend in Mitte.[1004] It was considered that safety could not be guaranteed with the larger number of spectators.[1005][1006][719][762] The Stadion an der Alten Försterei was known for its atmosphere and the Stadion der Weltjugend was located only a few minutes away from the home district of BFC Dynamo.[990][66] The move was therefore seen as a major disadvantage by the fans to Union Berlin and further diluted their aversion to BFC Dynamo.[45][66][nb 22] Union Berlin defeated BFC Dynamo 1–0 in front of 45,000 spectators at the Stadion der Weltjugend in the first meeting of the 1976–77 season on 4 September 1976.[1008][294][95] Union Berlin also won the return match on 19 February 1977.[95] The two wins against BFC Dynamo during the 1976–77 season cemented the reputation of Union Berlin as a cult club and crowd puller.[1009]\n\nBFC Dynamo established itself as one of the top teams in the DDR-Oberliga from the mid-1970s. Union Berlin would come to play second fiddle in East Berlin from now on and never finish higher than seventh place in the DDR-Oberliga.[1010] In the shadow of BFC Dynamo, Union Berlin would no longer have any major sporting significance in East Germany.[1011] Union Berlin became a yo-yo team that hovered between the Oberliga and the DDR-Liga.[1010] Supporters of Union Berlin saw BFC Dynamo as the highest representative of the security organs and the police, with privileges in player recruitment and financial support as well as the political clout of Mielke.[762] This was supposedly in contrast to their own club, which they regarded as an underdog rooted in the working class.[762][719][1012][753] BFC Dynamo would be disliked all over East Germany for its successes and its connection to the Stasi.[910][137][38] This was also reflected in the derby between BFC Dynamo and Union Berlin.[137] The supporters of Union Berlin were seen as oppositional.[137] This is illustrated in the famous sentence of the editor-in-chief of the satirical magazine Eulenspiegel: \"Not all Union fans are enemies of the state, but all enemies of the state are Union fans.\"[137][1013] But the fact that people supported Union Berlin did not automatically mean that they were against the state.[177] Union Berlin got a lot of sympathy as the weaker club.[177][1014] There was a simple rule in East German football, where the least privileged club got the most sympathy.[178] Supporters of Union Berlin cultivated the image of their club as the eternal underdog.[762][1015]\n\nClashes between the supporters of the two teams became increasingly common in the 1970s. Union Berlin had one of the most notorious followings in East Germany at this time.[32] The supporters of Union Berlin often went to away matches in large numbers.[32] Fights were initially won by the supporters of Union Berlin. They were in the clear majority and could chase the supporters of BFC Dynamo from the streets.[972] A punch in the face and a stolen scarf was an experience for many young supporters of BFC Dynamo at this time.[990] But BFC Dynamo gained more and more young supporters with its growing successes in the late 1970s.[174] Many came from working-class families in Prenzlauer Berg.[749] The supporters of BFC Dynamo would eventually begin to appear extremely well organized and by the early 1980s they began to fight back.[972][32] The tide now turned and the supporters of BFC Dynamo would win all fights between the supporters of the two teams from now on.[972][990] Derbies at the Stadion der Weltjugend usually ended with a couple of hundred supporters of BFC Dynamo chasing the supporters of Union Berlin along Chausseestraße down towards the Friedrichsstrasse S-Bahn station.[1016][32][1017] The fights often continued on the side streets of Friedrichstraße.[1017]\n\nUnion Berlin is sometimes portrayed as having been an opponent of the East German system and derbies between BFC Dynamo and Union Berlin during the East German era have been hyped as some kind of domestic political showdown.[1018] But Union Berlin was mostly just a club struggling against unfavorable conditions.[1018] The club had become disadvantaged by the state sports politics compared to local rival BFC Dynamo.[1018] Honorary President of Union Berlin Günter Mielis has said: \"Union was not a club of resistance fighters, but we had to fight against a lot of political and economic resistance over and over again. We got strength from our fans\".[1019] However, Union Berlin would eventually become known for a supporter scene that was anti-establishment, where dissidents could vent their disdain for the system in the anonymity of a crowd.[1010] Supporters of Union Berlin also saw themselves as stubborn and non-conformist, but this image should not be confused with actual resistance.[38] Provocation was part of football in East Germany and people shouted out anything, because it was possible to get away with it.[1020] A critical attitude to the system was something that football supporters across East Germany had in common in the 1970s and 1980s.[1021]\n\nSupporters of Union Berlin from the East German era concede that it is an exaggeration to call the club a \"resistance club\".[1022][970] A supporter of Union Berlin has said: \"With the best of intentions, Union fans did not contribute to the overthrow of the GDR. No way, we were interested in football. There is the cliché about the club for the enemies of the state, but that wasn\'t us\".[1023] There were no political groups among the supporters of Union Berlin.[1024] For some supporters of Union Berlin, the dissident reputation of Union Berlin is a legend that was created after Die Wende.[1022] A controversy erupted around Union Berlin in 2011 when it became publicly known that the then President of Union Berlin Dirk Zingler had been a member of the Stasi Guards Regiment \"Felix E. Dzerzhinsky\" for three years during his military service between 1983 and 1986.[1025][1026] Zingler explained that he had sought to spend his military service in Berlin and claimed that he did not know beforehand that the regiment belonged to the Stasi.[1027] However, the Stasi Guards Regiment \"Felix E. Dzerzhinsky\" was an elite formation; it was not possible to simply apply for the regiment. The Stasi selected who it thought were best fit to serve with the regiment, only accepting recruits that were \"loyal to the line\".[1027][1028] Zingler had also been a member of the Socialist Unity Party (SED) and leader in the Free German Youth (FDJ) at the time.[1029][1028] Union Berlin Press spokesman Christian Arbeit commented on the reports about Zingler in 2011 saying: \"We do have a very unique history, compared to other clubs. But it wasn\'t us that always claimed we were this big anti-Stasi club. These are stories that get simplified in the media.\"[1026]\n\nMost supporters of Union Berlin were just normal football supporters.[1020] Politics was not in the foreground.[970] Supporters of Union Berlin from the era have testified that their support for the club had nothing to do with politics.[1030] The club was the most important thing and the identification with Union Berlin had primarily to do with Köpenick.[1030][1031] The rivalry was fueled by local pride from the supporters of the two teams.[1032] However, the political dimension was there nonetheless.[1010] BFC Dynamo was supported by the Stasi, who was disliked by many.[1010] But above all, it was the political instrumentalization of football that irritated supporters of Union Berlin.[1033] The political favoritism of BFC Dynamo greatly contributed to the enthusiasm of the supporters of Union Berlin.[972] Supporters of Union Berlin embraced the image of the underdog fighting the odds.[1004] An expression of the supporters of Union Berlin was: \"Better to be a loser than a stupid Stasi pig\".[1011]\n\nThe derby between BFC Dynamo and Union Berlin was first and foremost a local football derby.[1010] Both clubs had supporters who were not loyal to the line.[1024][1034][751] Also supporters of BFC Dynamo were observed by the Stasi during the 1980s.[1035] East Berlin was divided into two: BFC Dynamo was more strongly represented in some parts, and Union Berlin was more strongly represented in other parts.[972] Which team you supported was very much a question of where you lived.[32] BFC Dynamo was the local team if you grew up in Prenzlauer Berg.[1036] And you lived in Mitte, you were also more likely to be a supporter BFC Dynamo, as the home stadium was only a stone\'s throw away along Schönhauser Allee.[32] But Mitte was also a contested area.[759] The border allegedly ran at Alexanderplatz, where many fights between the supporters of the two teams were fought.[972][760] The home districts of the two clubs, Hohenschönhausen and Köpenick respectively, were always dangerous territory for supporters of the other team.[972]\n\n\nBFC Dynamo midfielder Bernd Schulz (right) celebrating together with team captain Frank Rohde (left) after scoring a goal against 1. FC Union Berlin at the Stadion der Weltjugend on 18 March 1989.\nBFC Dynamo and Union Berlin met a total of 35 times in the DDR-Oberliga and the FDGB-Pokal. BFC Dynamo won 22 meetings and Union Berlin won 6 meetings. Matches against Union Berlin was often won with big numbers in the late 1970s and 1980s.[45][203] BFC Dynamo defeated Union Berlin with 1–8 and then 7–1 in the round of 16 of the 1978-79 FDGB-Pokal.[45] Hans-Jürgen Riediger scored a hat-trick in both legs.[1037][1038] BFC Dynamo also defeated Union Berlin 8–1 in the Oberliga on 13 September 1986. Thom, Frank Pastor and Christian Backs scored two goals each.[1039] The 1980s was a crushing win for BFC Dynamo. Former BFC Dynamo midfielder Falko Götz concluded that: \"Union was no opponent to us\".[1016] The two teams met 13 times in the Oberliga and FDGB-Pokal during the 1980s. BFC Dynamo won 11 matches and two matches ended in a draw. The matches between the two local rivals were hard-fought on the pitch.[294] Former BFC Dynamo midfielder Frank Terletzki has said that the victories against Union Berlin were always the best.[203] But despite the rivalry between the clubs, it happened that players hung out outside of football.[1040] Former BFC Dynamo defender Frank Rohde has said that players of BFC Dynamo and Union Berlin often gathered to have a beer together after matches.[294]\n\nThere were several transfers between the two clubs. BFC Dynamo recruited some of the best players of Union Berlin, such as Reinard Lauck in 1973, Detlef Helms in 1977 and Waldemar Ksienzyk in 1984.[45][970] But there were also transfers in the other direction. Union Berlin predecessor TSC Oberschöneweide recruited Ralf Quest from SC Dynamo Berlin in 1962. Quest scored the winning goal for Union Berlin in the final of the 1967-68 FDGB-Pokal, when the club won a sensational cup victory.[1041] Union Berlin would then recruit several players from BFC Dynamo over the years, such as Werner Heine in 1966, Werner Voigt, Bernd Kempke and Michael Jakob in 1973, Rainer Rohde in 1976, Rainer Wroblewski in 1977, Olaf Seier in 1983, Ralf Sträßer in 1984, Olaf Hirsch in 1986, Norbert Trieloff in 1987, Mario Maek in 1988, and Marco Kostmann and Thomas Grether in 1989, and Bernd Schulz in 1990.[95][970][294][1042] Union Berlin recruited a couple of players from BFC Dynamo in the 1980s who did some of their best seasons at the club.[1043][990] Olaf Seier became the team captain of Union Berlin and Ralf Sträßer became first and only player in Union Berlin to ever become league top goal scorer during the East German era.[65] Mario Maek saved Union Berlin from relegation with a late 3–2 goal against FC Karl-Marx-Stadt in the last match day of the 1987-88 DDR-Oberliga.[970][1044] As many as three former players of BFC Dynamo were involved in the winning goal for Union Berlin.[1044]\n\n\nSupporters of FC Berlin during a match against 1. FC Union Berlin at the Stadion an der Alten Försterei on 23 September 1990.\nUnion Berlin played in the DDR-Liga in the 1989–90 season. FC Berlin and Union Berlin met in the second round of the 1990-91 FDGB-Pokal at the Stadion an der Alten Försterei on 23 September 1990. It was the first match between the teams since the fall of the Berlin Wall. BFC Dynamo, now named FC Berlin, had now already lost many of its former top-performers to the West German Bundesliga.[1045][809] Union Berlin was now coached by the former BFC Dynamo player and youth coach Werner Voigt.[1046] Hooligans of FC Berlin stormed the home stands armed with clubs and flares and attacked supporters of Union Berlin at the beginning of the match.[263][809] Union Berlin won the match 2–1 on extra-time.[809] It was the first win for Union Berlin against FC Berlin since 1977.[263] Thomas Grether scored the first goal and Olaf Seier scored the winning goal for Union Berlin in the match. Both players had been brought up in the youth department of BFC Dynamo and had played matches for BFC Dynamo in the DDR-Oberliga.[809] Clashes between supporters of the two teams continued in the city after the match. Serious riots broke out in East Berlin, involving hundreds of supporters.[811]\n\nFC Berlin and Union Berlin then met in the promotion round to the 2. Bundesliga in the 1990–91 season. FC Berlin lost the first match 1–0 away in the second round at the Stadion an der Alten Försterei on 8 June 1991. Former BFC Dynamo player Bernd Schulz scored the winning goal for Union Berlin.[1047] FC Berlin then defeated Union Berlin 2–0 in the return match in fifth round in front of 9,475 spectators at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark on 18 June 1991. Heiko Bonan and Thorsten Boer scored one goal each in the match.[1048] FC Berlin was only one point behind leader BSG Stahl Brandenburg before the last round. The team managed to defeat Magdeburg 3–5 away on 23 June 1991. However, BSG Stahl Brandenburg defeated Union Berlin 2–0 away. FC Berlin thus finished in second place and missed promotion. Some supporters of BFC Dynamo are convinced that Union Berlin deliberately lost in order to prevent FC Berlin from advancing to the 2. Bundesliga.[257] FC Berlin and Union Berlin then also met in the promotion round for the 2. Bundesliga in 1991–92 season. FC Berlin won the first match 3–0 at home in the third round on 31 May 1992. The team then also won the return match 0–4 away in the fourth round on 7 June 1992.\n\nThe two teams met again in the new Regionalliga Nordost that was formed in 1994–95 season. Werner Voigt became the new coach of FC Berlin during the 1995–96 season. Voigt had a long history with BFC Dynamo but also had history with Union Berlin. Voigt had played for Union Berlin between 1973 and 1975 and had coached the team between 1990 and 1992.[1046] FC Berlin under coach Voigt lost 0–6 to 1. FC Union Berlin in the 1996–97 Regionalliga Nordost at the Stadion im Sportforum on 28 September 1996. It was the biggest defeat so far to Union Berlin.[294] Former FC Berlin player Thorsten Boer scored two goals for Union Berlin in the match.[1049] The two teams met 12 times in total in Regionalliga Nordost between 1994 and 2000. BFC Dynamo won one match and Union Berlin won eight matches. The two teams then met in the round of 16 of the 2000-01 Berlin Cup. The match was played in front of 4,427 spectators at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark on 24 March 2001.[351] Union Berlin won the match 0–3. Riots broke out among supporters of BFC Dynamo in Prenzlauer Berg after the match. The police had to deploy water cannons to control the situation.[855] The most recent meetings between BFC Dynamo and Union Berlin occurred in the 2005–06 NOFV-Oberliga Nord. The first match was played at the Stadion an der Alten Försterei on 21 August 2005. BFC Dynamo was missing striker Danny Kukulies and first-choice goalkeeper Nico Thomaschewski before the match. Kukulies was suspended and Thomaschewski injured.[1050][1051] German police and members of the SEK carried out a controversial raid against supporters of BFC Dynamo the night before the match.[440] Club management initially considered withdrawing from the match. The players voted on whether or not to play the match against Union Berlin.[865] More than 1,000 police officers were deployed to the match.[1016] BFC Dynamo eventually lost 8–0.[970] The return match was played at the Stadion im Sportforum on 13 May 2006. The score was 1–1 when around 200 supporters of BFC Dynamo stormed the pitch to attack supporters of Union Berlin.[456][871][873] Supporters of Union Berlin fled the guest block in panic.[872] The match was abandoned and Union Berlin was awarded a 2–0 victory.[871][873] The two teams has not met since then.\n\nBFC Dynamo met the reserve team of Union Berlin six times in the NOFV-Oberliga Nord and Regionalliga Nordost between 2010 and 2015. Union Berlin II won the first five matches. The last match was played in the 2014-15 Regionalliga Nordost on 15 March 2015. BFC Dynamo defeated Union Berlin II 1–0 in front of 8,169 spectators at Stadion an der Alten Försterei. The match was interrupted for 18 minutes when supporters of Union Berlin tried to attack the supporters of BFC Dynamo.[552][1052][45] 112 police officers were injured and 175 supporters were arrested during the match.[1053][45] Some media reported that 300 supporters of Union Berlin had participated in the attack on guest supporters. Journalist Frank Willmann attended the match and claims that the number was rather 30. He also said he did not see any injured police.[1052] There have been several cases of violence between the supporters of the two teams during the 2010s.[1054] Around a hundred hooligans from Union Berlin tried to attack a senior tournament organized by BFC Dynamo in the Dynamo-Sporthalle on 30 January 2010.[1055][1056][1057][875] Also women and children got in the way of the attack.[1057] Around 30 partially masked supporters from Union Berlin attacked players and a small group of supporters of BFC Dynamo in connection with a senior match between Union Berlin and BFC Dynamo at the Sportanlage Hämmerlingstraße in Köpenick on 27 March 2015.[1058][45][1054] One player of BFC Dynamo and two guest spectators were injured.[45] A number of supporters of BFC Dynamo joined Hertha BSC in the guest block of the Stadion an der Alten Försterei during the derby between Union Berlin and Hertha BSC on 2 November 2019.[899]\n\nOrganization\nCurrent board and management\nAs of 1 August 2023[1059][1060][1061][1062][1063]\nBerliner Fussball Club Dynamo e.

The DDR-Oberliga was rebranded as the NOFV-Oberliga from the 1990–91 season. The league was then replaced by the Bundesliga as the highest competition from the 1991–92 season, as East Germany had joined West Germany to form the reunited Germany.\n\nDomestic\nEast German Champions\nWinners: (10) 1978–79, 1979–80, 1980–81, 1981–82, 1982–83, 1983–84, 1984–85, 1985–86, 1986–87, 1987–88 (record)\nRunners-up: (4) 1960,[a] 1971–72, 1975–76, 1988–89\nFDGB-Pokal\nWinners: (3) 1959,[a] 1987–88, 1988–89\nRunners-up: (6) 1961–62,[a] 1970–71, 1978–79, 1981–82, 1983–84, 1984–85\nDFV-Supercup\nWinners: 1989\nFuwo-Pokal (de)\nRunners-up: 1972[b]\nDDR-Liga (II)\nWinners: 1957,[a]\nDDR-Liga Nord (II)\nWinners: 1967–68\nDDR-Liga B (II)\nWinners: 1971–72[c]\nRunners-up: 1974–75[c]\nDDR-Liga A (II)\nWinners: 1984–85[c]\n Won by SC Dynamo Berlin.\n The Fuwo-Pokal was only arranged in 1972.

The U17 team competes in the third tier B-Junior Verbandsliga Berlin and the U19 team competes in second tier A-Junior Regionalliga Nordost.[1094] The youth teams are based in the Sportforum Hohenschönhausen.[637]\n\nThere were more than 800 children and youth players in the club as of 2019.[1095] Many children in the club comes from immigrant backgrounds or socially disadvantaged families.[637][1096][626][753][608][634] BFC Dynamo helped football club FC Berlin 23 from neighbouring Storkower Straße in September 2021 and saved more than 40 to 50 children from the club, which was about to be dissolved.[608]\n\nThe club launched the so-called \"Kita-projekt\" in 2003.[637] The Kita-projekt is a day care project that gives boys and girls aged 3 to 6 the opportunity to participate in sports on a regular basis.[637][1097] The Kita-projekt involved approximately 200 children from 16 day care centers in Berlin as of 2020.[1096] The majority of the children come from the localities or former boroughs of Lichtenberg, Hohenschönhausen, Karlshorst, Mitte, Weißensee and Pankow.[1097] The Kita-projekt was the first of its kind in Germany and has received several awards for its work with children.[637][1098][1099] The former professional player of BFC Dynamo Jörn Lenz is the head of the Kita-projekt as of 2021.[1099]\n\nThe so-called \"Jugendförderverein\" was founded in 2004.[426] It is a registered voluntary association that aims to promote youth sports at BFC Dynamo. The Jugendförderverein has supported youth teams with equipment, covered costs for trips to tournaments and helped youth trainers to be able to obtain their trainer license. The Jugendförderverein relies on donations and voluntary work.[1100] Former Club President Mario Weinkauf was one of the seven founding members of the Jugenförderverein and briefly served as chairman of the association before he became club president. Weinkauf had also been a youth trainer in the club for some time.[426]\n\nYouth academy during East German era\nBFC Dynamo had a very successful youth academy during the East German era.[1016][174][201] The youth department had full-time trainers available for all youth classes and access to the best material conditions in the Dynamo-Sportforum.[105][1101] There were no less than 40 full-time trainers in the club.[928] Youth coaches were highly qualified and training in the Children and Youth Sports School (KJS) was extensive.[1102][1103] The youth work at BFC Dynamo during the East German era was described as \"absolutely leading\" by former coach Jürgen Bogs, who had a background as coach of the junior team.[105][1101] It was also described as \"exquisite\" by former German sports journalist Horst Friedemann, who worked for Deutsches Sportecho and Kicker.[201]\n\nThe upper tier of elite clubs in East Germany had privileged access to talents within designated geographical and administrative areas.[4][1104] All designated football clubs were assigned one or two regional districts in East Germany as catchment areas at their founding in 1965–1966. BFC Dynamo was initially assigned Bezirk Cottbus and one third of the districts in East Berlin.[35][65] The club was later allowed to take over the training centers (German: Trainingszentrum) (TZ) in East Berlin that had previously belonged to the catchment area of FC Vorwärts Berlin, when FC Vorwärts Berlin was relocated to Frankfurt an der Oder before the 1971-72 season.[64][65]\n\nHowever, BFC Dynamo, as well as FC Vorwärts Berlin and SG Dynamo Dresden, also had another structural advantage when it came to recruiting talents.[1105] Most sports associations (German: Sportvereinigung) (SV) were dissolved at the founding of the DTSB in 1957.[1106] However, sports associations SV Dynamo and ASV Vorwärts were allowed to continue exist.[1107] A decision in the SED Politburo in 1962 then stipulated that the sports associations SV Dynamo and ASV Vorwärts were allowed to set up sports communities in each location where they operated offices. This meant that SV Dynamo and ASV Vorwärts would be able to run sports communities across the country.[1108] BFC Dynamo would eventually be able recruit talents from the youth departments of all sports communities (German: Sportgemeinschaft) (SG) of SV Dynamo in East Germany, except those in Bezirk Dresden and a number of other sports communities in the southern regional districts that belonged to the catchment area of SG Dynamo Dresden.[105][4][1109][nb 39]\n\nThe basis of the East German selection and screening system in competitive sports would eventually consist of special training centers (TZ).[1113][1114][nb 40] SV Dynamo would operate numerous training centers across the whole of East Germany. The training centers were either assigned to BFC Dynamo or SG Dynamo Dresden, depending on catchment area. Training in these training centers were better than elsewhere. The work in the training centers was supervised and directed by BFC Dynamo. The best talents from the individual training centers were then brought together and selected in a multi-day screening session.[69] BFC Dynamo would come to benefit from a nationwide scouting network, which included the partnership with Bezirk Cottbus and 33 training centers (TZ) of SV Dynamo.[1118][1119][68] In total, BFC Dynamo had access to 38 training centers (TZ) across East Germany for the recruitment of talents. As a comparison, Union Berlin had only access to six training centers (TZ), all of which were located in the Berlin area.[70]\n\nA number of football clubs became specially promoted focus clubs in the 1970 DFV Football Resolution.[60][999] The focus clubs would receive additional financial support from the DTSB and other advantages.[998][996] In the 1976 DFV Football Resolution, focus clubs were also allowed delegate youth players from other football clubs.[1001] BFC Dynamo became the focus club in East Berlin. As a focus club, BFC Dynamo had the right to delegate 12 students to its affiliated Children and Youth Sports Schools (KJS) every year.[1109][1002] Non-focus football clubs only had the right to delegate six students to their affiliated Children and Youth Sports School (KJS) every year.[1002] The elite Children and Youth Sports School (KJS) \"Werner Seelenbinder\" provided boarding and schooling for talented players in the Sportforum.[1120][1121][1107] The Children and Youth Sports School (KJS) \"Werner Seelenbinder\" was affiliated to sports club SC Dynamo Berlin.[1122]\n\nThe success of BFC Dynamo during the East German era was based on the club\'s extensive youth work.[1123][1124][105][201] In 1975, there were as many as five national team players in the East Germany junior national football team among the club\'s youth players from the class of 1957.[98]1 Only a fifth of the players who won the ten East German championships with BFC Dynamo were older than 18 years when they joined the club.[990] The youth academy produced stars such as Lutz Eigendorf, Falko Götz and Andreas Thom.[1120][1016][1102][752] Most of the top performers of BFC Dynamo in the 1980s came through the club\'s own youth teams, including Frank Terletzki, Hans-Jürgen Riediger, Norbert Trieloff, Bodo Rudwaleit, Ralf Sträßer, Artur Ullrich, Rainer Ernst, Bernd Schulz, Christian Backs, Frank Rohde, Falko Götz, Jan Voß, Andreas Thom, Jörg Fügner, Hendrik Herzog and Marco Köller.[1125][1126][1127] Several former players of SC Dynamo Berlin and BFC Dynamo became youth trainers in the club after ending their playing careers, such as Herbert Schoen, Hermann Bley, Günter Schröter, Martin Skaba, Peter Rohde, Werner Voigt, Hartmut Pelka and Hans-Jürgen Riediger.[1128][1129][1125][1130][1131]\n\nNumerous players from East Germany joined West German clubs at the end of East Germany. Many came from BFC Dynamo. More than 110 players who had been trained in East Germany, primarily in a Children and Youth Sports School (KJS), would go on to play for West German or West Berlin clubs in the Bundesliga after the end of East Germany. German author Michael Peter has created a database for all players who had been trained in East Germany and who played for West German or West Berlin football clubs after 1990. For players born before 1976, BFC Dynamo was the biggest contributor. 98 players, born before 1976, came from the ten designated football clubs and SG Dynamo Dresden. 18 of these, came from BFC Dynamo.[1108]\n\nHonours\nNext Generation Oberliga (German: Nachwuchsoberliga) (de)[a]\nWinners: 1981, 1991[b]\nRunners-up (6): 1979, 1983\nEast German Junior Championship (de)[c]\nWinners: (5) 1960,[d] 1978, 1979, 1987, 1991\nRunners-up (6): 1967, 1974, 1976, 1977, 1988, 1989\nEast German Youth Championship (Youth FDJ-Pokal) (de)[e]\nWinners: (4) 1967, 1972, 1975, 1987\nRunners-up: 1983, 1989\nEast German Junior Cup (Junge Welt-Pokal) (de)[c]\nWinners: (5) 1966, 1967, 1987, 1989, 1990[b] (record)\nEast German Youth Cup (Youth FDGB-Pokal)[e]\nWinners: (5) 1965,[d] 1968, 1971, 1972, 1976 (record)\n Corresponds to U21 level. The league existed from 1976 to 1983 and 1989 to 1991. The reserve teams of the 14 DDR-Oberliga clubs were no longer allowed to participate in the DDR-Liga after the 1975-76 season. The Junior Oberliga (de) was also disbanded after the season. The Next Generation Oberliga was introduced instead. Youth teams of the 14 DDR-Oberliga clubs were all were eligible to start in the 1976-77 Next Generation Oberliga. Next Generation Oberliga was disbanded after the 1982-83 season. All teams were instead assigned to the third tier Bezirksliga. BFC Dynamo participted in the 1983-84 Bezirksliga Berlin with reseve team BFC Dynamo II. BFC Dynamo II won the 1983-84 Bezirksliga Berlin and qualified for the 1984-85 DDR-Liga A.\n Won as FC Berlin.\n Corresponds to U19 level.\n Won by SC Dynamo Berlin.\n Corresponds to U17 level.\nExplanatory notes\n This was not the first or last relocation or transfer of entire football teams in East Germany at the time. Sports association SV Deutsche Volkpolizei relocated its three second-tier teams SV Deutsche Volkspolizei Potsdam, SV Deutsche Volkspolizei Weimar and SV Deutsche Volkspolizei Schwerin to sports communities in larger cities during the summer of 1952. SV Deutsche Volkspolizei Potsdam was relocated to Berlin, SV Deutsche Volkspolizei Weimar to Erfurt and SV Deutsche Volkspolizei Schwerin to Rostock.[6]The team of SV Vorwärts der KVP Leipzig was relocated to East Berlin in 1953. The team continued the 1953-54 DDR-Oberliga as SV Vorwärts der KVP Berlin. SV Vorwärts der KVP Berlin then became ASK Vorwärts Berlin, which later became FC Vorwärts Berlin.[7][4] The relatively successful team of BSG Empor Lauter and its place in the DDR-Oberliga was transferred to sports club SC Empor Rostock in 1954. The football department of SC Empor Rostock later became F.C. Hansa Rostock.[8] The team of BSG Turbine Halle and its place in the DDR-Oberliga was transferred to sports club SC Chemie Halle-Leuna in 1954.[9] The football department of SC Chemie Halle-Leuna later became Hallescher FC Chemie.\n SG Dynamo Dresden itself had a background that involved political interference and player delegations. SG Dynamo Dresden was previously known as SV Deutsche Volkspolizei Dresden. When SG Friedrichstadt was dissolved by East German sports authorities after the 1949–50 DDR-Oberliga, the playing right in the DDR-Oberliga was transferred to SV Deutsche Volkspolizei Dresden.[10][8][11] SV Deutsche Volkspolizei Dresden had previously played in the lower-tier Stadtliga Dresden and was thus able to enter the DDR-Oberliga without having to progress through divisions.[12][13] In order to keep the place in the DDR-Oberliga, the team of SV Deutsche Volkspolizei Dresden would be reinforced with players from Volkspolizei teams all over the country.[14] The head of the Volkspolizei Kurt Fischer ordered that best football players in the sports communities of the Volkspolizei around East Germany should be concentrated in the now first-tier SV Deutsche Volkspolizei Dresden.[15] The 40 best players of the various Volkspolizei teams in East Germany were then brought together for a training session in Forst in July 1950. Coaches Fritz Sack and Paul Döring then picked out 17 players from 11 different cities who were delegated to Dresden to form the team.[16][11] SV Deutsche Volkspolizei Potsdam lost its five best players and was severaly weakened.[13][17]\n However, newspaper Neues Deutschland reported an attendance number of 60,000 spectators.[20]\n BFC Dynamo played friendly matches against Pogoń Szczecin in 1966, 1969, 1973, two times in 1975, 1977, two times in 1978, 1980, 1984, 1985, 1986 and 1987.[43]\n SV Dynamo would eventually operate numerous training centers (TZ) across East Germany. The training centers were divided between BFC Dynamo and SG Dynamo Dresden depending on catchment area.[69]\n German author Steffen Karas also claims in his book \"66 Jahre BFC Dynamo - Auswärts mit \'nem Bus\" that BFC Dynamo actually only scored nine match-deciding goals in the 86th minute or later, in the 218 matches it won or drew during its ten championship years. Only one of those goals came from a penalty. That penalty was the controversial penalty against 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig in the 1985-86 DDR-Oberliga on 22 March 1986, which was later proven to be correct.[205]\n Karin Halsch was known as Karin Seidel-Kalmutzki at the time.[339]\n Sources vary on the history of the stadium. A few sources state that the stadium was constructed in 1954 and then refurbished in 1973.[685][693] A centrally located football stadium is depicted in the early plans for the Dynamo-Sportforum by architects Walter Schmidt and Heinz Scharlipp.[694] Other sources suggest that the stadium was completed in its current form in 1970.[695][688][696]\n The capacity was 12,000 at the beginning of the 1966–67 season and 14,000 at the beginning of the 1968–69 season.[706][707]\n The skinhead movement in East Germany grew out of the punk subculture, and was characterized as an aggressive form of protest.[777][778] It was radicalized in the middle of the 1980s, by a hybrid of ultranationalism, xenophobia and anti-communism.[778] East Berlin was the epicenter of the East German skinhead movement, with BFC Dynamo and 1. FC Union Berlin as its two football magnets.[778][779] The Stasi concluded that about 30-40 skinheads were associated to the two clubs in December 1985. Many were attached to fan cub Anale Berlin at BFC Dynamo.[778] Anale Berlin became infamous for its violence capital and glorification of fascism.[778][779] There were around 300–400 skinheads in East Berlin in December 1987.[780][717] Many were fans of BFC Dynamo.[717] Reports noted a group of roughly 100 skinheads that regularly attended the away matches of BFC Dynamo in 1988.[781] And the Stasi estimated that there were about 30 skinheads among the followers of 1. FC Union Berlin in July 1988.[4][781] Despite the fierce rivalry between BFC Dynamo and 1. FC Union Berlin, there were contacts between skinheads of the two clubs.[32] Far-right skinheads were attached to fan clubs Borussen and Die Löwen at 1. FC Union Berlin.[772][782]\n However, hooligans of BFC Dynamo and skinheads allegedly attached to the hooligan scene of BFC Dynamo were also involved in serious incidents associated with racism and right wing-extremism in the 1980s. Hooligans of BFC Dynamo attacked 26 Cuban guest workers on train D 1056 towards Berlin-Lichtenberg, while returning from a match in Halle on 12 May 1984.[788][789] The hooligans had allegedly shouted racist slogans and sung the Deutschlandlied. At least nine Cubans were injured.[790] A number of skinheads allegedly attached to the hooligan scene of BFC Dynamo were also among those convicted for the much-publicized attack on a punk concert in the Zionskirche church in East Berlin on 17 October 1987.[178][137] However, incidents associated to racism and right-wing extremism in East German football were not isolated to BFC Dynamo and authorities also recorded the use of racists slogans, such as \"Jewish pigs!\", by supporters of several other teams at the time, including SG Dynamo Dresden and 1. FC Union Berlin.[791][792][793]\n Several sources claim that a group of 500 hooligans of BFC Dynamo attacked a gas station, looted shops and attacked the Volkspolizei in Jena in November 1989.[32][799][459][788][798] One source specifically claims that the incidents occurred in connection to an away match in the DDR-Oberliga.[799] However, the sources do not specify any exact date or any details regarding which match the incidents occur in connection with. FC Berlin played away against FC Carl Zeiss Jena in the 18th matchday of the 1989-90 DDR-Oberliga on 8 April 1990.\n Hooligans in Magdeburg attacked Soviet soldiers on 29 August 1990. One officer fired a warning shot.[803] The police fired warning shots during violent riots after the friendly match between 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig and FC Bayern Munich on 6 September 1990.[803][813][815] The match between FC Sachsen Leipzig and FC Carl Zeiss Jena in the 1990-91 NOFV-Oberliga on 29 September 1990 was abandoned shortly before the end due to violent riots in the stadium.[813][814]\n However, the high number of supporters of FC Berlin at the scene claimed by the police has been disputed.[820] The number of supporters of FC Berlin on the scene varies between different sources. The police initially stated that they had faced up to 500 hooligans.[817][824] However, an eyewitness stated that the group that arrived at the S-Bahn station and marched towards the stadium rather consisted of only 150 supporters. This group was supposedly met by around 50 police officers outside the stadium.[820] Neues Deutschland reported that the number of rioters outside the stadium \"grew to around 400 to 500 hooligans\".[819] A common figure is that 400 supporters of FC Berlin arrived at the S-Bahn station after kick-off.[823][802][825][264] A supporter of FC Berlin has said in Zeit that there were almost 500 supporters of FC Berlin outside the stadium.[265]\n Another legend tells that Erich Mielke made a remark about bringing the title to Berlin after the fractious encounter between Dynamo Dresden and BFC Dynamo on 2 December 1978, when he allegedly walked into the locker room of Dynamo Dresden and told the players that \"You must understand, the capital city needs a champion!\".[923] However, according to another version, he instead made this remark when the players of Dynamo Dresden celebrated their title in 1978 and he allegedly ghosted into their locker room to inform them that BFC Dynamo will be champions next year.[924] And according to yet another version, this happened instead after BFC Dynamo had won its second title in 1980, when Erich Mielke allegedly told the players of Dynamo Dresden that \"One must understand, the capital city needs a champion.\"[178] Dynamo Dresden was one point ahead of BFC Dynamo before the last match day of the 1979-80 DDR-Oberliga. BFC Dynamo met Dynamo Dresden home in the last matchday on 10 May 1980. BFC Dynamo won the match 1-0 and captured the league title. Dynamo Dresden player Udo Schmuck remembers how Mielke came into the locker room of Dynamo Dresden after the match with a gold medal around his neck. He allegedly said: \"It doesn\'t matter. The main thing is that Dynamo is champion!\".[925] Mielke is also said to have told Dynamo Dresden player Hans-Jürgen Dörner at the same occasion; \"Comrade Dörner, it is clear to all of you that the title belongs in the capital, now it\'s the turn of the BFC.\"[926]\n Former SG Dynamo Dresden coach Klaus Sammer claimed in an interview with Berliner Zeitung in 2003 that with \"a few exceptions\", SG Dynamo Dresden was only able to fall back on the Bezirk Dresden as catchment area.[929] However, Bezirk Dresden was one of the most populous regional districts in East Germany. East German sports journalist Horst Friedemann claims that the SV Dynamo sports communities (SG) of Eisleben and Halle/Neustadt also belonged to the catchment area of SG Dynamo Dresden. They were located under the \"southern line\", where Dresden had access.[930] SG Dynamo Dresden also had access to training centers (TZ) of SV Dynamo. SV Dynamo operated numerous training centers across East Germany. The training centers were either assigned to BFC Dynamo or SG Dynamo Dresden, depending on catchment area.[931] In total, SG Dynamo Dresden had 35 partner associations (German: Partnervereine), including training centers (TZ). Their task was mainly to scout the best players and then send them to Dresden.[932] German sports historian Hanns Leske has categorized SG Dynamo Dresden as the third most privileged football club or sports community in East German football, behind FC Vorwärts Berlin and BFC Dynamo.[933]\n Supporters of 1. FC Union Berlin used the same provocation at away matches in Saxony, despite their cultivation of their club\'s underdog image. A supporter of 1. FC Union Berlin has testified that they brought Cuban organges and rotten bananas to an away match against FC Karl-Marx-Stadt, fully aware that these fruits were symbols of their privileges as East Berliners.[962]\n BFC Dynamo was officially a club of the Ministry of the Interior.[973] The official sponsor (German: Träger) of the club was the Volkspolizei.[36] The official sponsor of Union Berlin was the state-owned combine VVB Hochspannungsgeräte und Kabel.[974]\n The football clubs had been assigned one or two districts in East Germany as catchment areas at their founding. 1. FC Union Berlin had been assigned Bezirk Potsdam and one third of all training centers (TZ) in East Berlin. BFC Dynamo had been assigned Bezirk Cottbus and one third of training centers (TZ) in East Berlin. BFC Dynamo now had access to Bezirk Cottbus and two thirds of all training centers (TZ) in East Berlin. 1. FC Union Berlin on the other hand had to make do with its training centers (TZ) in East Berlin.[35][970]\n FC Vorwärts Berlin was initially a focus club in East Berlin.[1000] The only major club in East Berlin that was never appointed as focus club was 1. FC Union Berlin.[60] FC Vorwärts Berlin continued to be part of the group of focus clubs after its relocation to Frankfurt an der Oder.[1000]\n Football clubs were given performance assignments from the DTSB that had to be fulfilled. The clubs then had to report on the fulfillment in two-year analyzes. Union Berlin had the objective in 1977-78 of producing four players who could be delegated to the focus club BFC Dynamo. Union Berlin explained that its downward trend in the youth area was due to the fact that the club had to delegate its two best players to the focus club every year and that the club could only rely on four districts in East Berlin for further selection.[978]\n The club management of 1. FC Union Berlin seriously considered moving all matches to Stadion der Weltjugend after a stormy encounter with BSG Wismut Aue in 1976.[1007]\n Manfred Kirste was the first president and is the longest serving president. He served as president from 15 January 1966 to 30 August 1988.\n Served as president until 19 Februari 1990.[1064]\n Became acting president after the dismissal of Herbert Krafft on 19 February 1990. Bogs served as acting president until 27 May 1990.[1064]\n Dr. Klaus Janz served as president until 15 October 1990.[1065] He asked to be relieved from the office due to professional stress as a lawyer. He continued as vice president.[1066]\n Dr. Wolfgang Hösrich became president on 15 October 1990. He had a background as a club doctor for SC Dynamo Berlin and BFC Dynamo. Hösrich had previously served as vice president.[1067][1066] The presidium under Dr. Wolfgang Hösrich was replaced by a new presidium under Eberhard Landmann on 20 May 1994.[1068][1069][1070]\n Eberhard Landmann became president on 20 May 1994.[1071] Landmann was a former insurance salesman. He only served as president for nine months.[1068][1069][1072]\n Klaus Bittroff was elected as the new president on 10 February 1995 with the votes 73-11. Volkmar Wanski was elected as one of two vice presidents alongside re-elected Lutz Hoff.[1073][1072][1071] Bittroff had previously served as president of Wacker 04 Berlin from 1984 to 1991.[1071]\n Became new president after the resignation of Klaus Bittroff on 14 September 1995.[287] Wanski resigned on 29 June 2000.[335][1072][1074]\n Sports director Hans Reker was appointed acting president by the Economic council following the resignation of Volkmar Wanski on 29 June 2000.[335][1074] Karin Halsch took office as new president on 27 September 2000.[339]\n Karin Halsch was known as Karin Seidel-Kalmutzki during the era. Served from 27 September 2000 to 25 June 2001.[339][1075]\n Sports director Hans Reker served as acting president following the resignation of Karin Halsch on 25 June 2001.[1075][356] Hans Reker held the position of vice president in the presidium of Karin Halsch.[1076][346] He resigned together with the entire presidium on 30 October 2001.[376] An emergency board formed by André Sommer, Rayk Bernt and press spokesman Holger Zimmermann took office. The emergency board was meant to serve until the extraordinary general meeting on 26 November 2001.[376][387]\n An emergency board formed by André Sommer, Rayk Bernt and press spokesman Holger Zimmermann took office on 1 November 2001. No new president was appointed for the transitional board.[376][387] Zimmerman soon resigned on 23 November 2001.[653] A new presidium was due to be elected on the extraordinary general meeting on 26 November 2001. However, the meeting agenda was changed with the votes 87 to 59 at the insistence of the emergency board. The meeting was converted into an information event and new elections were postponed.[653][1077] Club members collected signatures for the election of a new presidium. But the signatures would be ignored by Sommer and Bernt.[388] The Sommer and Bernt presidium was finally overthrown by supporters and the former coach of the women\'s team Volkmar Lucius after an application to the Charlottenburg district court.[388][401] The Charlottenburg district court appointed Lucius as emergency board member.[388] A new presidium was elected on the extraordinary general meeting on 31 May 2002.[1078]\n Elected on an extraordinary general meeting on 31 May 2002.[1078]\n Mario Weinkauf was elected president on 18 June 2004.[426] He resigned on a meeting with the presidium on 22 June 2007. He was then dismissed in a vote of no-confidence on an extra-ordinary general meeting on 23 June 2007. Mario Weinkauf was succeeded by Volkmar Wanski as interim president. Volkmar Wanski had been co-opted into the presidium and elected as the provisional successor to Mario Weinkauf on the meeting with the presidium on 22 June 2007. However the interim presidency of Volkmar Wanski was controversial. It was put into question whether his election was compliant with club statutes. Volkmar Wanski resigned after only six days.[1079][1080][1081]\n Frank Bertron was launched as interim president by the Economic Council under Peter Meyer.[487][1081] He was presented as new president on 28 June 2007.[1081]\n Norbert Uhlig is the second longest serving president after Manfred Kirste. Norbert Uhlig has been president since 11 October 2008.[1082]\n German sports historian Hanns Leske writes that BFC Dynamo was able to recruit young players from the youth departments of all sports communities (SG) of SV Dynamo in East Germany, except those in Bezirk Dresden.[1110] German author Anne Hahn writes that the training centers (TZ) of SV Dynamo across East Germany were divided between BFC Dynamo and SG Dynamo Dresden. She writes that the catchment area of BFC Dynamo included the SV Dynamo sports communities (SG) of Rostock-Mitte, Neustrelitz, Fürstenwalde, Schwerin and Berlin. The best talents were brought together in these training centers and then selected in a central, multi-day screening courses.[931] Also Horst Friedemann claims that the catchment area of BFC Dynamo included the SV Dynamo sports communities (SG) of Rostock-Mitte, Neustrelitz, Fürstenwalde and Schwerin. According to Friedemann, the SV Dynamo sports communities (SG) of Eisleben and Halle/Neustadt instead belonged to the catchment area of SG Dynamo Dresden. That was the \"southern line\", where Dresden had access.[1111][1112]\n The training centers (TZ) were the first preparatory stage for the support of children found suitable for sports. Training in training centers usually started at the age of 10.[1115] The training course usually lasted for three to four years.[1115] From the training centers, the best young talents could then be delegated to a Children and Youth Sports School (KJS) and a Sports club (SC) or a Football club (FC).[1116][1113][1117]\nReferences\nTemplate:Reflist\n\nFurther reading\nTemplate:Cite news\nBertram, Marco (2015).

V., commonly abbreviated to BFC Dynamo (German pronunciation: [beːʔɛfˌt͡seː dyˈnaːmo] (listen)) or BFC (German pronunciation: [beːʔɛfˈt͡seː] (listen)), alternatively sometimes called Dynamo Berlin, is a German football club based in the locality of Alt-Hohenschönhausen of the borough of Lichtenberg of Berlin. BFC Dynamo was founded in 1966 from the football department of SC Dynamo Berlin and became one of the most successful clubs in East German football. The club is the record champion of East Germany with ten consecutive league championships from 1979 through 1988. BFC Dynamo competes in the fourth tier Regionalliga Nordost. The club enjoys a cross-city rivalry with 1. FC Union Berlin and a historical rivalry with SG Dynamo Dresden. The rivalry with Union Berlin is part of the Berlin derby.\\n\\nHistory\\nBackgrund, founding and rise (1954–1978)\\nMain article: History of Berliner FC Dynamo (1954–1978)\\nBackground: SC Dynamo Berlin (1954–1966)\\nBFC Dynamo started as a football department of sports club SC Dynamo Berlin. SC Dynamo Berlin was founded on 1 October 1954 as one of the new elite sports clubs in East Germany.[2] The sports club was affiliated to sport association SV Dynamo. In order to establish a competitive side in Berlin, the team of SG Dynamo Dresden and its place in the DDR-Oberliga was transferred to the new sports club SC Dynamo Berlin. The relocation was designed to give the capital a team that would rival teams from West Berlin such as Hertha BSC, which were still popular in East Berlin.[3][4][5][nb 1][nb 2]\\n\\n\\nGünter Schröter (left), Horst Kohle of ASK Vorwärts Berlin (centre) and Martin Skaba (right) during a match between Vorwärts Berlin and Dynamo Berlin at the Walther-Ulbricht-Stadion on 18 October 1959\\nThe team played its first match as SC Dynamo Berlin against BSG Rotation Babelsberg in the 1954-55 DDR-Oberliga on 21 November 1954. Among the players delegated from SG Dynamo Dresden were Johannes Matzen, Herbert Schoen and Günter Schröter. SC Dynamo Berlin finished its first season in the DDR-Oberliga in seventh place. The team was relatively successful in the 1955 DDR-Oberliga, but suffered relegation to the second tier DDR-Liga after the 1956 DDR-Oberliga. SC Dynamo Berlin played a friendly match against Polish side Górniczy KS Szombierki Bytom in front of 80,000 spectators at the Walter-Ulricht-Stadion on 9 May 1957.[18][19] The attendance number is allegedly the highest in the history of the club.[19][nb 3] SC Dynamo Berlin eventually finished the 1957 DDR-Liga in first place immediately returned to the DDR-Oberliga.\\n\\nGünter Schröter and Herbert Maschke would remain central players to the team into early the 1960s. But most other players of the former SG Dynamo Dresden team were no longer active in the team by the late 1950s.[21] Herbert Schoen had played his last competitive matches for the team during the 1957 season and Johannes Matzen had suffered a serious injury during the 1958 season and consequently had to end his playing career.[22] The team was now instead shaped by a new generation of players, including Martin Skaba, Werner Heine, Waldemar Mühlbächer, Hermann Bley and Konrad Dorner (de).[23]\\n\\n\\nThe team of SC Dynamo Berlin after winning the 1959 FDGB-Pokal, at the Bruno-Plache-Stadion in Leipzig on 13 December 1959\\nSC Dynamo Berlin had difficulties establishing itself in football in East Berlin.[17] The team rarely drawing crowds larger than 5,000 spectators at the Walter-Ulbricht-Stadion. SC Dynamo Berlin finally won its first trophy in the 1959 FDGB-Pokal. However, the team would not be allowed to participate in the 1960-61 European Cup Winners\' Cup. The East German Football Association (DFV) found local rival and league runner-up ASK Vorwärts Berlin to be a more suitable representative of East Germany in the competition.[24]\\n\\nSC Dynamo Berlin also had some success in the first seasons of the 1960s. The team fished the 1960 DDR-Oberliga as runner-up. SC Dynamo Berlin was a top team also in the 1961-62 DDR-Oberliga. The team participated in the 1961–62 International Football Cup during the summer of 1961. SC Dynamo Berlin was successful in 1961-62 FDGB-Pokal. The team was only defeated 1-3 by SC Chemie Halle in the final.[25] However, SC Dynamo Berlin still found itself overshadowed in the capital by the army-sponsored ASK Vorwärts Berlin.[26] The team of SC Dynamo Berlin during the 1960s would eventually prove relatively weak.[27] SC Dynamo Berlin had become a lower table side by the end of the 1962–63 Oberliga.[21]\\n\\nEast German football was reformed in 1965–66, when the football departments of ten sports clubs (SC) were made independent from their sports clubs to form ten dedicated football clubs. The new designated football clubs (FC) would form the elite of East German football. As part of the reorganization, the football section of SC Dynamo Berlin was separated from the sports club and reorganized as football club BFC Dynamo.[28][29][4][30] The football department of sports community SG Dynamo Hohenschönhausen was also disbanded after the 1965–66 season. The players of SG Dynamo Hochenschönhausen joined the reserve team BFC Dynamo II and BFC Dynamo II took over the place of SG Dynamo Hohenschönhausen in the 1966-67 Bezirksliga Berlin.\\n\\nFounding and second relegation (1966–1967)\\nBFC Dynamo was founded on 15 January 1966.[31] The new club was presented by the President of SV Dynamo Erich Mielke at a ceremony in the Dynamo-Sporthalle in Hohenschönhausen in East Berlin.[32] The first presidium included the Head of the Volkspolizei in East Berlin Horst Ende, the Intendant of the Metropol theatre Hans Pitra, former DDR-Oberliga player Johannes Matzen and the Editor-in-chief of the East German football weekly Die Neue Fußballwoche (FuWo) (de) Klaus Schlegel.[33] Manfred Kirste was elected club president and Mielke was elected honorary president.[32][31] Kirste came from Berlin and was a certified sports teacher.[34]\\n\\n\\nThe match between BFC Dynamo and FC Vorwärts Berlin in the DDR-Oberliga at the Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum on 13 August 1966\\nThe new designated football clubs (FC) were formed as centers of excellence in East German football, with the right to draw on talents within designated geographical and administrative areas.[4][29] BFC Dynamo was initiallly assigned Bezirk Cottbus and one third of East Berlin as catchment area.[35] BFC Dynamo was officially a club of the Ministry of the Interior, and the club\'s official sponsor was the Volkspolizei.[36][37] However, the honorary chairman Mielke was the head of the Stasi and most of the club\'s sponsoring members would eventually be made up of Stasi employees. BFC Dynamo would come to receive personal, organizational and financial support from the Stasi.[37][38] Research by the Stasi Records Agency has shown that 31 employees of the Ministry of the Interior and ten employees of the Stasi would eventually be involved in the club.[39]\\n\\nSC Dynamo Berlin had been in first place in the 1965-66 DDR-Oberliga after the eighth matchday.[40] BFC Dynamo were still in a good fourth place after a 2–0 win over BSG Chemie Leipzig on the 23rd matchday on 16 April 1966. However, the team then lost its last three matches in the league, against F.C. Hansa Rostock, SG Dynamo Dresden and FC Rot-Weiß Erfurt, and finished the season in ninth place.[41]\\n\\nHungarian Bela Volentik was new coach for the 1966–67 season. The team played a friendly match against Polish side Pogoń Szczecin on 10 September 1966. The match would be one of many in a long series of friendly maches against Pogoń Szczecin during the East German era.[42][nb 4] The team struggled in the 1966-67 DDR-Oberliga. BFC Dynamo faced local rivals 1. FC Union Berlin away on the 22nd matchday on 26 April 1967. BFC Dynamo was in 13th place in the league and threatened with relegation.[44][45] Supporters of 1. FC Union Berlin mocked the team with a banner saying \\\"We greet the relegated\\\". 1. FC Union Berlin won the match 3-0 and BFC Dynamo was now practically relegated.[45] The match is seen as the starting point for the feud between the two clubs.[45] BFC Dynamo eventually finished the 1966-67 DDR-Oberliga in 13th place and was again relegated to the DDR-Liga. Long-time player Waldemar Mühlbächer retired from his playing career after the season.[46] Mühlbächer had joined SC Dynamo Berlin in 1956 and had played 11 seasons for the team.[47]\\n\\nRejuvenation and first UEFA competition (1967–1972)\\nFormer SC Dynamo Berlin forward Karl Schäffner returned as coach for the 1967–68 season.[48] BFC Dynamo dominated the 1967-68 DDR-Liga Nord. The team was undefeated during the second half of the league season and immediately won promotion back to the DDR-Oberliga.[49] Forward Peter Lyszczan became tied league top goalscorer in the 1967-68 DDR-Liga Nord with 19 goals.[50] Martin Skaba and Hermann Bley retired after the 1967–68 season and Konrad Dorner was transferred to the reserve team BFC Dynamo II.[51] The three had joined SC Dynamo Berlin between 1956 and 1958. Skaba had played in a total of 343 matches for the team.[52]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo began a rejuvenation of the team during the 1967–68 season.[51] Among the players from the youth department who got to play matches in the 1967-68 DDR-Liga Nord were Harald Schütze (de), Norbert Johannsen and Werner Voigt.[53] BFC Dynamo fielded a young team in the 1968–69 season. The average age of the team was 23 years at the start of the season.[54] Harald Schütze was now a regular player in the team.[51] BFC Dynamo got off to a difficult start on its return to the DDR-Oberliga. Hans Geitel took over as coach for the second half of the season. Geitel had previously worked in the youth academy of BFC Dynamo.[55] The team finished the 1968-69 DDR-Oberliga in tenth place.\\n\\nBFC Dynamo recruited young forward Ralf Schulenberg from FC Rot-Weiß Erfurt for the 1969–70 season.[56] Schulenberg was probably compensation for the talented Günter Wolff, who had left BFC Dynamo for FC Rot-Weiß Erfurt after the 1967–68 season.[55] A number of players from the youth departments would also make their debut in the DDR-Oberliga in the following seasons, such as Peter Rohde (de) in 1969, Frank Terletzki in 1969 and Bernd Brillat in 1970. BFC Dynamo reached the final of the 1970-71 FDGB-Pokal. The team lost the final 1–2 in overtime to SG Dynamo Dresden, but qualified for the next season\'s UEFA Cup Winners\' Cup as runner-up.[57] This time, the team would also be allowed to participate in the competition, unlike in 1960. BFC Dynamo was thus finally ready for its first participation in an UEFA competition.[58]\\n\\nA number of football clubs became specially promoted focus clubs (German: Schwerpunktclubs) in the 1970 DFV Football Resolution (German: DFV-Fußballbeschluss).[59][60] BFC Dynamo and FC Vorwärts Berlin became focus clubs in East Berlin.[60][61] The football landscape in East Berlin would then change dramatically ahead of the 1971–72 season, when the Ministry of Defense decided to relocate FC Vortwärts Berlin to Frankfurt an der Oder.[62][63] BFC Dynamo and 1. FC Union Berlin were from now on the only major football clubs in East Berlin.[64] BFC Dynamo would be allowed to take over the catchment area in East Berlin that had previously belonged to FC Vorwärts Berlin.[65][64] The team would also have the opportunity to play more matches at the larger and more centrally located Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark in Prenzlauer Berg, which led to increased interest in the club and growing attendance numbers.[66]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo stood out among other teams within SV Dynamo. BFC Dynamo was located at the frontline of the Cold War. It was also a representative of the East German capital. This meant that the club had to be well equipped.[67] BFC Dynamo would eventually get access to a nationwide scouting network, including numerous training centers (German: Trainingszentrum) (TZ) of SV Dynamo across East Germany.[68][nb 5] BFC Dynamo would eventually be able to recruit young talented players from 38 training centers (TZ) across East Germany.

Terletzki had played in a total of 489 matches for BFC Dynamo since 1969.[172]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo had the best material conditions in the league and the best team by far.[173] But controversial refereeing decisions in favor of BFC Dynamo gave rise to speculation that the dominance of BFC Dynamo was not solely due to athletic performance, but also due to help from referees.[174] BFC Dynamo was a representative of both the Stasi and the capital. The team was therefore viewed with more suspicion than affection.[175][174] The overbearing success of BFC Dynamo in the 1980s made fans of opposing teams easily aroused as to what they saw as manipulation by bent referees.[173][176] The team was met with aggression and shouts such as \\\"Bent champions!\\\" (German: Schiebermeister) and \\\"Jews Berlin!\\\" at away matches.[177][4][178][179] Complaints of alleged referee bias accumulated.[173][4][180] The German Football Association of the GDR (DFV) eventually conducted a secret review of the 1984-85 DDR-Oberliga.[173][167][181] Among other things, the review found that BFC Dynamo had earned only one third of the yellow cards incurred by rival SG Dynamo Dresden.[182][183][181] A review was also made of the final of the 1984-85 FDGB-Pokal final between BFC Dynamo and SG Dynamo Dresden. This review found that 30 percent of the referee decisions were wrong, and that 80 percent of those had been of disadvantage to SG Dynamo Dresden.[184][185][186][181] A number of referees were sanctioned for their performances in matches involving BFC Dynamo in the following months, including the referees involved in the cup final.[4][186][181]\\n\\nA particularly controversial episode was the penalty awarded to BFC Dynamo by referee Bernd Stumpf in extra time in the match between 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig and BFC Dynamo on 22 March 1986. The penalty caused a wave of protests.[167][187][174] SED General Secretary Erich Honecker and Secretary for Security, Youth and Sport of the SED Central Committee Egon Krenz were fed up with the \\\"football question\\\" and the \\\"BFC-discussion\\\".[167] An example was consequently made out of referee Stumpf. He was permanently banned from refereeing by the DFV.[165] The sanctions against Stumpf were approved by Honecker and Krenz in the SED Central Committee.[188][189] However, a previously unknown video recording of the match was published by Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk (MDR) in 2000. The video recording showed that the penalty was correctly awarded and that the sanctions against Stumpf were unjustified.[165][178][190]\\n\\n\\\"I can imagine there was referee manipulation due to the immense pressure from the government and Ministry for State Security. That could have made some referees nervous and influenced their decisions. But we were the strongest team at the time. We didn\'t need their help.\\\"\\n\\nFalko Götz[191]\\nThe benefit of controlling important matches in Western Europe might have put indirect pressure on the referees to take preventive measures, in so-called preventive obedience.[192][193][194][195][175] In order pursue an international career, a referee would need a travel permit, confirmed by the Stasi.[188][181][196] It become known after the German reunification that several referees had also been Unofficial collaborators (IM) of the Stasi.[167][197][198][199] However, there is no evidence to show that referees were under direct instructions from the Stasi and no document has ever been found in the archives that gave the Stasi a mandate to bribe referees.[197][194][200][201]\\n\\nThe picture that the success of BFC Dynamo relied upon referee bias is dismissed by former BFC Dynamo players and coaches. Some of them admit that there might have been cases of referee bias, but they all insist that it was the thoroughness of their youth work and the quality of their play that earned them their titles.[202][174][191][203] Former coach Jürgen Bogs has said: \\\"You cannot postpone 26 matches in one season in the DDR-Oberliga. At that time we had the best football team\\\".[204][190][nb 6] BFC Dynamo was able to filter the best talents through nationwide screening and train them in its youth academy. The youth academy had full-time trainers employed for every age group.[206] As a trainer of the DDR-Oberliga team, Bogs worked with modern training methods, such as video evalutations, which was not yet common in East Germany. The club also applied heart rate and lactate measurements during training, which only came to the Bundesliga many years later.[207][190] Former referee Bernd Heynemann has concluded: \\\"The BFC is not ten times champions because the referees only whistled for Dynamo. They were already strong as a bear.\\\"[208]\\n\\nLast titles in East Germany (1986–1989)\\n\\nMarco Köller (left) and Heiko Scholz of 1.

The winning goal was scored by Burkhard Reich.[222] The team then defeated FC Carl Zeiss Jena 2–0 in front of 40,000 spectators at the Stadion der Weltjugend in the final of the 1987–88 FDGB-Pokal and finally completed the Double.[223] Andreas Thom was eventually voted the 1988 East German footballer of the year.[224]\\n\\n\\nAndreas Thom receiving the 1988 East German footballer of the year award from the Die Neue Fußballwoche (de) editor-in-chief Jürgen Nöldner on 13 August 1988.\\nLong-time club president Manfred Kirste was replaced by Herbert Krafft ahead of the 1988–89 season.[225] Krafft had a background in the Volkspolizei.[226] BFC Dynamo was drawn against West German champions SV Werder Bremen in the first round of the 1988-89 European Cup. The first match was played at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark. Among the spectators was the former West German Chancellor Willy Brandt. BFC Dynamo sensationally won the match 3–0.[227] Bodo Rudwaleit was a match hero, with numerous saves.[228] However, the team lost the return leg at the Weser-Stadion with 5–0. The return leg in Bremen would become known as the second \\\"Miracle on the Weser\\\".[228][227] It has been rumored that the spectacular loss in the return leg was explained by BFC Dynamo having been given doping before the home game in East Berlin.[105][229] A more likely explanation, however, is that the players could not cope with the enormous pressure before the return leg.[229] It has also been rumored that the players were distracted from their pre-match preparations by shopping opportunities, which had been arranged by SV Werder Bremen manager Willi Lemke.[229][230] BFC Dynamo lost important points to its league rivals in the autumn and finished the first half of the season in fourth place, a full nine points behind SG Dynamo Dresden. It was the team\'s worst result after a first half of the season in the league in 14 years.[231]\\n\\nAverage attendance had dropped from 15,000 to 9,000 during the team\'s most successful years in the 1980s.[173] Ordinary fans feared the Stasi and had become disillusioned with political interference. Particularly aggravating were the restrictions on ticket sales that the Stasi imposed at international matches for political reasons. Only a few tickets were sold to ordinary fans for matches in the European Cup against opponents such as Hamburger SV and SV Werder Bremen. The majority was instead sold to a politically hand-picked audience.[190][232] BFC Dynamo also saw the emergence of a well-organized hooligan scene during the 1980s.[174][178] The development was partly a response to the increasing state repression against the supporter scene.[190]\\n\\n\\nThe team celebrates the victory in the 1988-89 FDGB-Pokal at the Stadion der Weltjugend on 1 April 1989.\\nBFC Dynamo met local rival 1. FC Union Berlin on the 16th matchday of the 1988-89 DDR-Oberliga on 18 March 1989. 1. FC Union Berlin now fielded as many as four former BFC Dynamo players in the starting line-up: Olaf Seier, Mario Maek, Thomas Grether and Norbert Trieloff.[233] BFC Dynamo reached the final of the FDGB-Pokal for the second consecutive season. The team met Karl-Marx-Stadt in the final of the 1988-89 FDGB-Pokal. BFC Dynamo won the match 1–0 in front of 35,000 spectators at the Stadion de Weltjugend and captured its second consecutive cup title. The winning goal was scored by Anderas Thom in the 57th minute.[234] BFC Dynamo eventually finished the 1988-89 DDR-Oberliga as runner-up. Defender Jens-Uwe Zöphel and midfielder Jörn Lenz from the youth department made their debuts for BFC Dynamo in the DDR-Oberliga during the 1988–89 season.[235][236]\\n\\nHelmut Jäschke replaced Jürgen Bogs as coach for the 1989–90 season.[237] As the winner of the 1988-89 FDGB-Pokal, BFC Dynamo was set to play the DFV-Supercup against new league champions SG Dynamo Dresden. The match was played at the Stadion der Freundschaft in Cottbus on 5 August 1989.[238] BFC Dynamo won the match 4-1 and thus became the first and only winner of the DFV-Supercup in the history of East German football.\\n\\nGerman reunification and decline (1989–2004)\\nMain article: History of Berliner FC Dynamo (1989–2004)\\nThe Peaceful revolution, FC Berlin and failed promotion (1989–1991)\\n\\nThe new BFC Dynamo coach Helmut Jäschke during the match against FC Rot-Weiß Erfurt on the first matchday of the 1989-90 DDR-Oberliga on 12 August 1989\\nThe 1989–90 season was tumultuous for BFC Dynamo. Frank Pastor was transferred to BSG Aktivist Schwarze Pumpe at the beginning of the season. BFC Dynamo was qualified for the 1989–90 European Cup Winners\' Cup as winners of the 1988–89 FDGB-Pokal. The team was eliminated in the second round by AS Monaco on the away goals rule. Coach Helmut Jäschke then decided to place young goalkeeper Oskar Kosche in the following match. Long-time goalkeeper Bodo Rudwaleit ten suddenly announced his immediate retirement from football.[239] The East German regime faltered under pressure from political mass demonstrations and events in neighboring countries. Parts of the Berlin Wall were opened on 9 November 1989 and East German citizens could now freely travel to West Berlin. The Stasi was transformed into the Office for National Security (German: Amt für Nationale Sicherheit) (AfNS) on 17 November 1989.[240] The transformation also ended the tenure of Erich Mielke as Minister of State Security.[241] He would soon be dismissed as the First Chairman of SV Dynamo as well.[242][226] Andreas Thom was signed to Bayer Leverkusen by Bayer Leverkusen manager Reiner Calmund. The transfer became official on 12 December 1989. Thom thus became the first player in the DDR-Oberliga to leave for the West German Bundesliga.[243] The transfer fee amounted to 2,5 million Deutsche Mark.[243]\\n\\n\\nThe team of FC Berlin at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark on 23 February 1990.\\nBodo Rudwaleit was transferred to BSG Stahl Einsenhüttenstadt and Bernd Schulz to BSG Bergmann-Borsig during the 1989–1990 winter break. The dismantling of the team from the 1980s was now well underway.[244] Coach Jäschke was dismissed during the winter break and was replaced by Peter Rohde.[245] Rohde had played 159 league- and 14 international matches for BFC Dynamo between 1969 and 1978 and was an older brother of team captain Frank Rohde.[245] The AfNS was eventually completely dissolved on 13 January 1990.[240] With the dissolution of the Stasi, BFC Dynamo had lost a major sponsor. The Ministry of the Interior announced that it was only prepared to support the club until the end of the 1989–90 season.[246][247][248] The fate of the club was uncertain. BFC Dynamo was rebranded as FC Berlin on 19 February 1990.[249][250] Club President Herbert Krafft was dismissed at the same time and Jürgen Bogs took over as interim president until new club elections could be held.[249] The team participated in the first edition of the indoor tournament \\\"Internationales Berliner Hallenfussballurnier\\\" in the Werner-Seelenbinder-Halle. Teams from West Berlin, such as Hertha BSC also participated. FC Berlin lost the final against arch-rival 1. FC Union Berlin with 4–5. Thomas Doll became the best goal scorer of the tournament with 12 goals.[251] The second half of the season started well, but it soon became clear that FC Berlin would not would not have a chance at the title.[252] FC Berlin finished the 1989-90 DDR-Oberliga in fourth place and failed for the first time in a long time to qualify for a European tournament.[253] Attendance dropped from 7,271 in the fall of 1989 to just 3,383 in the spring of 1990.[254] The team lost Thomas Doll and Frank Rohde to Hamburger SV and Rainer Ernst to 1. FC Kaiserslautern after the season.[255][256]\\n\\n\\nDirk Rehbein chasing the ball during a match between FC Berlin and HFC Chemie at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark on 10 November 1990.\\nThe team was joined by Dirk Rehbein from SC Fortuna Köln during the summer of 1990. FC Berlin participated in the 1990 Intertoto Cup 30 June 1990 and 17 July 1990. FC Berlin had sold off almost all its offensive players during the 1989–90 season and the team finished the tournament in third place.[257][258][259] FC Berlin also recruited Mikhail Pronichev from FC Lokomotiv Moscow for the 1990–91 season.[260][261] The team began the 1990-91 NOFV-Oberliga with four consecutive defeats and was in last place in the league after the fourth matchday. Jürgen Bogs returned as coach.[262][263] A wave of hooliganism swept through East Germany in 1990.[178] One of the largest hooligan scenes in Germany was formed around FC Berlin.[253] 18-year-old FC Berlin supporter Mike Polley was shot dead by police during riots in Leutzsch in connection with the match between FC Sachsen Leipzig and FC Berlin on 3 November 1990. The police had fired between 50 and 100 shots in one minute.[264] The hooligan scene of FC Berlin would shape the entire 1990–91 season.[265] FC Berlin continued to struggle in the second half of the league season. The team was in 12th place in the league towards the end of the season.[266] However, FC Berlin won its last two matches in the league, against Chemnitzer FC and FC Victoria 91 Frankfurt, and finished the 1990-91 NOFV-Oberliga in 11th place.[266] The team was thus qualified for the play-off for the 2. Bundesliga. FC Berlin was one point behind leaders BSV Stahl Brandeburg before the final round. The team defeated 1. FC Magdeburg 3–5 away, but BSV Stahl Brandenburg defeated 1. FC Union Berlin 0–2 away. FC Berlin thus finished in second place and just narrowly failed to qualify for the 2. Bundesliga.[267][268][257] The team lost several key-players after the season, such as Heiko Bonan, Burkhard Reich, Waldemar Ksienzyk, Thorsten Boer, Eike Küttner and Hendrik Herzog.[268][269]\\n\\nDecline (1991-1994)\\nFC Berlin recruited midfielder Ralf Rambow from Eisenhüttenstädter FC Stahl for the 1991–92 season. The 1991–92 season was the first season when teams from East Germany and teams from West Germany played in the same league system. The NOFV-Oberliga was now at third tier in the league system. FC Berlin was qualified for the 1991-92 DFB-Pokal as a participant in the 1990–91 2. Bundesliga play-off. It was the club\'s first participation in the DFB-Pokal. The team was drawn against SC Freiburg. The starting eleven included players such as Oskar Kosche, Christian Backs, Jens-Uwe Zöphel, Jörg Fügner, Mario Tolkmitt and Mikhail Pronichev. FC Berlin lost the match 0–2.[270] Heiko Brestrich returned to the team during the summer of 1991.[271] Brestrich would be a key-player of FC Berlin in the 1990s. FC Berlin came to dominate the 1991-92 NOFV-Oberliga. The team lost only two matches during the entire league season and scored a total of 97 goals.[272] FC Berlin was once again qualified for the play-off for the 2. Bundesliga. The team finished the play-off in third place. Volkswagen-backed VfL Wolfsburg won the play-off, which meant that no team from the former East Germany was able to advance.[272] FC Berlin lost 11 players after the 1991–92 season, including Mario Tolkmitt, Christian Backs, Jörn Lenz, Jörg Fügner and Oskar Kosche.[273][274] In total, FC Berlin lost two complete teams in the first one or two years after the fall of the Berlin Wall.[256]\\n\\nFailing to win win promotion to the 2. Bundesliga, FC Berlin had to continue at amateur level. The main competitors in the following seasons of the NOFV-Oberliga Nord were teams such as Tennis Borussia Berlin, BSV Stahl Brandenburg and Eisenhüttenstädter FC Stahl. With the many player departures after the 1991–92 season, Jürgen Bogs once again had to build a new team.[273] FC Berlin recruited forward Bernd Jopek for 1. FC Union Berlin and midfielder Stefan Oesker from Blau-Weiß 1890 Berlin for the 1992–93 season.[273] The team was also strengthened by a number of youth players.[273] FC Berlin now had to rely on its youth department to supply the team with new players.[275] The team finished the 1992-93 NOFV-Oberliga Nord in fourth place. Dirk Rehbein and Ralf Rambow left for 1. FC Union Berlin after the season.[276][277] FC Berlin was no longer the absolute treasure trove among former East German clubs, but continued to produce talent thanks to its excellent youth work.[277] Among the players from the youth department on the squad in 1993–94 season were Jens Reckmann, Mike Jesse, Ronny Nikol, Michael Franke, Marcell Fensch and Rayk Schröder.[278][275][273][276][277] The team of FC Berlin that played against Spandauer SV on the fifth matchday on 9 September 1993 had an avagerage age of only 21,33 and was the youngest team of BFC Dynamo to have ever played a competitive match.[279] Helmut Koch replaced Jürgen Bogs as coach on 28 September 1993.[280] FC Berlin finished the 1993-94 NOFV-Oberliga Nord in fourth place and qualified for the new Regionalliga Nordost.\\n\\nRegionalliga Nordost and first Berlin cup title (1994–1999)\\nMario Kallnik returned to the club for the 1994–95 season. The re-instated Regionalliga would now form the new third tier in the German football league system. The 1994-95 Regionalliga Nordost meant new meetings with well-known opponents such as FC Carl Zeiss Jena, 1. FC Union Berlin and FC Rot-Weiß Erfurt.[281] BFC Dynamo struggled in the 1994-95 Regionalliga Nordost, but managed to retain its place in the league.[282] Jens-Uwe Zöphel left the team for FC Energie Cottbus after the season. The team was joined by goalkeeper Daniel Bartel from the youth department for the 1995–96 season. Bartel became the new first-choice goalkeeper at the beginning of the season. The highlights of the 1995-96 Regionalliga Nordost were new meetings with old rival 1. FC Dynamo Dresden.[283] The two teams had not met since the 1990–91 season.[284][281] The first meeting was played in front of 2,002 spectators at the Stadion im Sportforum on 8 September 1995. The score was 1–3 at half break.[283] The match ended 4–3 to 1. FC Dynamo Dresden.[284][281] Club President Klaus Bittroff resigned on 14 September 1995 and Vice president Volkmar Wanski became the new club president.[285] The team had a difficult start to the 1995-95 Regionalliga Nordost. Due to acute danger of relegation, coach Koch was dismissed on 17 October 1995. Werner Voigt became the new coach.[286][287] Voigt had a long background in the club as a player and coach. With Voigt, the experienced defender Mario Maek also returned to the club.[286] FC Berlin organized one of the biggest youth football tournaments so far in the eastern part of the country in the Sportforum Hohenschönhausen on 6–8 April 1996. As many as 30 youth teams from clubs such as Chelsea F.C., Everton F.C., Feyenoord, FC Bayern München and Borussia Dortmund participated.[288][287] FC Berlin found itself in the relegation zone towards the end of the 1995-95 Regionalliga Nordost.[289] The place in the league was saved with a 1–0 win over FSV Wacker 90 Nordhausen on the 33rd matchday, 19 May 1996. The winning goal was scored by Mario Maek.[283]\\n\\nExperienced players such as Heiko Brestrich, Mario Maek, and Jens Reckmann would form the team\'s backbone during the 1996–67 season.[290] FC Berlin defeated 1. FC Dynamo Dresden 2–0 in the opening match of the 1996–97 Regionalliga Nordost in front of 2,300 spectators at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark.[291] Then followed a sharp decline.[292] The team would lose 6–0 away to its other rival 1. FC Union on the ninth matchday.[293] It was the biggest loss to date against 1. FC Union Berlin.[294] Club President Wanski announced on 26 November 1996 that the financial reserves had been used up.[287] The millions of Deutsche Mark that the club had made from player transfers in the early 1990s were now gone.[295] Wanski would then support the club every year with personal contributions.[296][297] During the second half of the 1995–96 season, he became shirt sponsor with his own company Regio Bautenschutz GmbH.[290] The shirts had not had a sponsor in almost seven years.[290] FC Berlin also signed a two-year sponsoring contract with the Italian sportswear manufacturer Fila during the spring of 1996, where Fila became the club\'s equipment sponsor. The club previously had no equipment sponsor.[298] Fila had reportedly been impressed by the club\'s youth work.[298] FC Berlin finished the 1996-67 Regionaliga Nordost on 13th place after another weak season. Mikhail Pronichev left the team for TuS Makkabi Berlin and Jens Reckmann for 1. FC Dynamo Dresden after the season.\\n\\nThe team recruited Croatian defender Davor Krznarić for the 1997–98 season. The 1997-98 Regionalliga Nordost was also a struggle, with the team in 12th place in the league at the winter break.[299] The club still received New Year\'s greetings from Real Madrid and Liverpool F.C. in 1997.[300] Experienced defender Jörn Lenz returned to the club during the winter break.[301] Lenz would be a key player for several seasons to come. The successes in the Regionalliga Nordost had not materialized. It became known that coach Voigt had signed for 1. FC Dynamo Dresden for the 1998–99 season. The club and Voigt decided to part ways.[302] Assistant coach Ingo Rentzsch took over on 12 March 1998.[303] The team played an exciting 5–5 draw away against 1. FC Magdeburg away on the 33rd matchday, 5 May 1998. Bernd Jopek, Jörn Lenz, Davor Krznarić, Marek Seruga, and Mario Kallnik scored one goal each in the match.[303][304] New coach for the 1998–99 season was Henry Häusler.[305] Players central to the team in the 1998–99 season were Heiko Brestrich, Jörn Lenz, Mario Maek, Martino Gatti, Mario Kallnik, Davor Krznarić, Timo Lesch, and Sven Ohly, with Lenz as team captain.[305][306] Coach Häusler was eventually dismissed on 18 March 1999 and assistant coach Ingo Rentzsch again took over as interim coach.[307] Club President Wanski came up with the idea to revive the old name BFC Dynamo during the autumn of 1998. He said: \\\"We stand by Dynamo\'s sporting tradition, we reject the club\'s political past.\\\"[308][297] An overwhelming majority at the general meeting on 8 May 1999 voted to take back the old name.[309] The team met local rival Union Berlin on the penultimate matchday of the 1998-99 Regionalliga Nordost, 8 May 1999. The team now again competed as BFC Dynamo. Coach Rentzsch threw in the towel at half-time and left the stadium, allegedly because Club President Wanski had wanted to dictate the line-up.[310][311][312] Youth trainer Norbert Paepke took over as coach in the second half of the match.[310][313] BFC Dynamo won the derby 2–0 with two goals by Marcel Solomo in front of 2,543 spectators at the Stadion an der Alten Försterei.[314] BFC Dynamo reached the final of the 1998-99 Berlin Cup. The team defeated Berlin Türkspor 1965 with 4–1 in the final on 11 May 1999 and finally won its first Berlin Cup title. Ayhan Gezen and Mario Maek scored one goal each, and Heiko Brestrich scored two goals for BFC Dynamo in the final.[315]\\n\\nRelegation to NOFV-Oberliga and crash (1999–2001)\\nBFC Dynamo recruited goalkeeper Nico Thomaschewski for the 1999–2000 season. Thomaschewski became the new first-choice goalkeeper. Torsten Boer, Jens Reckmann and Dirk Rehbein also returned to the club.[316][317] The team was also joined by forward Marcel Riediger from the youth department. Marcel Riediger was the son of former BFC Dynamo striker Hans-Jürgen Riediger.[318][319] The team lost 0–2 to Arminia Bielefeld the first round of the 1999-2000 DFB-Pokal.[320] BFC Dynamo defeated SG Dynamo Dresden 1–0 on the sixth matchday.[316] The team stood at a sensational second place in the league after the eight matchday, but then followed a sharp descline.[321][322] BFC Dynamo suffered a period of crisis during the autumn of 1999.[323] The financial difficulties had continued. The number of sponsors was too few and the club was financially dependent on Club President Volkmar Wanski. The number of spectators also remained low and new sponsors were deterred by hooliganism.[311] The team went through several league matches without a single win. Heiko Brestrich eventually rebelled against coach Klaus Goldbach in early November 1999 and was suspended. He was then sacked and transferred to VfB Leipzig.[324][325][326][327] Brestrich was very popular with the supporters of BFC Dynamo and was popularly called \\\"Heiko Brestrich - Football God\\\" (German: Heiko Brestrich - Fußballgott).[324][328] He had played a total of 301 matches for BFC Dynamo during his career, including 282 matches between 1991 and 1999.[324][329] The team was joined by Russian striker Denis Kozlov later the same month. Kozlov would eventually prove successful at BFC Dynamo. Coach Goldbach was eventually dismissed in early December 1999 and Jürgen Bogs returned for his third stint as coach.[330]\\n\\nThe club finally got a promising main sponsor in the form of the software company Lipro AG at the beginning of 2000.[331][332] However, the difficulties in the league continued and the club\'s liabilities had already started to become significant.[332] BFC Dynamo finished the 1999-2000 Regionalliga Nordost in 17th place and was relegated to the NOFV-Oberliga Nord. For the first time in its history, BFC Dynamo was now a fourth tier team.[333] BFC Dynamo reached the final of the Berlin Cup for a second consecutive season, but lost the final of the 1999-2000 Berlin Cup 2–0 against the reserve team of Tennis Borussia Berlin.[334] Club President Wanski resigned on 29 June 2000.[335][336][337] The reason was allegedly that the sponsor Lipro AG demanded greater influence in club decision making.[335][336] The club was now temporary in the hands of Sports director Hans Reker.[335] Mario Maek retired as a player after the 1999–2000 season and several players left the team, including Thorsten Boer and Martino Gatti.[335][336] A new team was put together for the 2000-01 NOFV-Oberliga Nord. The budget for the season was 2.3 million Deutsche Mark, which set new record for the NOFV-Oberliga Nord.[336] The team was joined by striker Dirk Vollmar, Cameroonian midfielder Aka Adek Mba, Brazilian midfielder Alexandre Vieira dos Santos, nicknamed \\\"Macalé\\\", as well as five Romanian players: Dănuț Oprea, Silvian Cristescu, Aurel Panait, Dorel Zegrean, and Florin Bătrânu.[336][338] SPD-politician Karin Halsch became new club president on 27 September 2000.[339][340][nb 7] BFC Dynamo dominated the 2000-01 NOFV-Oberliga Nord. The team was drawn against arch-rival 1. FC Union Berlin in the quarter-finals of the 2000-01 Berlin Cup The match was played in front of 4,427 spectators at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark on 24 March 2001. BFC Dynamo lost 3–0.[341] Serious riots broke out after the match when BFC Dynamo supporters clashed with the police.[342] The team finished the 2000-01 NOFV-Oberliga in first place, with only three losses in 34 matches.[343] Denis Kozlov had scored a wopping 29 goals for BFC Dynamo in the league.[343] The team would now face 1. FC Magdeburg in a play-off for promotion to the Regionalliga Nord.\\n\\nHowever, it had become apparent that the club had serious financial problems two weeks before the play-offs. Players and coaches had received their January salaries in March and had not received any salaries since. The club was also behind with insurance payments.[344][345][346] The German Football Association (DFB) demanded that the club could provide a bank guarantee of 4.2 million Deutsche Mark to secure the budget for the possible 2001–02 Regionalliga Nord. It was already clear before the first match in the play-offs that the club would have difficulty meeting the requirements of the DFB in the event of promotion.[343][347] The first match of the play-offs ended 0–0 in front of 8,282 spectators at the Stadion im Sportforum on 2 June 2001.[348] The second match was played at the Ernst-Grube-Stadion in Magdeburg on 9 June 2001. Around 2,000 supporters from BFC Dynamo traveled to the second match.[349][350] The score was 2–2 at half time. BFC Dynamo was practically promoted at this point.[348] However, the team ultimately lost the match 2–5.[348][351] The club\'s debts were now estimated at 1.5 million Deutsche Mark.[352] And now, also the main sponsor Lipro AG was in financial trouble.[353][354] Several players left the club directly after the 2000–01 season, including Marcel Riediger and Denis Kozlov.[343][352]\\n\\nInsolvency (2001–2002)\\nInsurance company AOK filed for insolvency against BFC Dynamo on 21 June 2001. The company demanded 126,000 Deutsche Mark in unpaid insurance payments.[355] Club President Karin Halsch resigned on 25 June 2001.[355] There had been major discrepancies between Halsch and sports director Hans Reker regarding how the situation should be resolved.[355] Reker took over as acting president.[356] Supporters of BFC Dynamo started the fundraiser \\\"Save BFC Dynamo\\\" (German: Rettet den BFC). The fundraiser quickly succeeded in raising 40,000 Euros.[357][358][359] More players left the team during the summer of 2001, including Mario Kallnik and Aka Adeck Mba.[360] The debts were estimated at 5 millions Deutsche Mark, of which 4.2 million were loans from Lipro AG and 1.3 short-term debts, at this point.[361] The club tried to initiate a partnership with FC Dynamo Moscow, in which BFC Dynamo would serve as a farm team for FC Dynamo Moscow in Europe.[362] But the plan led nowhere.[363] A preliminary insolvency administrator was appointed at the end of August 2001.[364] It was estimated that insolvency proceedings could be opened on 1 November 2001.[365] Insolvency proceedings were opened against main sponsor Lipro AG on 5 October 2001.[366]\\n\\nThe preliminary insolvency administrator estimated the club\'s debts at 6 million Deutsche Mark.[367] BFC Dynamo needed 30,000 Deutsche Mark by 31 October 2001 in order to commence insolvency proceedings.[368] However, the club did not have the money.[369] Discussions with new sponsors failed.[370] If insolvency proceedings could not be opened, the club would go bankrupt and have to restart in the Kreisliga under a new name.[363][365][371][368] Supporters organized a demonstration that marched from the Sportforum Hohenschönhausen to the Rotes Rathaus. Also former players such as Hans-Jürgen Riediger, Rainer Troppa, Waldemar Ksienzyk and Heiko Brestrich planned to participate. The demonstration was received at the Rotes Rathaus by former club president and SPD-politician Halsch.[369][372][368] A group of sponsors around former president Volkmar Waski finally came forward and offered the money required to commence insolvency proceedings.[373][374] The club\'s entire presidium resigned on 31 October 2001.[375][337] An emergency board formed by André Sommer, Rayk Bernt and press spokesman Holger Zimmermann was appointed by the club\'s Economic Council.[376][370]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo is said to have made millions on player sales after Die Wende.[356][377][378] The club was for a time considered the richest amateur club in Germany.[295] But not all the money had went to the club, some had also went to SV Dynamo, DFV and advisers.[379][380] The club\'s reputation as the former Stasi club made it difficult to win new sponsors.[296][381][356][382] The club was also plagued by hooliganism, which repeatedly caused negative headlines.[382][340] FC Berlin failed to qualify for the 2. Bundesliga and never progressed beyond the third tier of the German football league system.[383] The number of spectators was only a couple of hundred per match in the early 1990s and the income from membership fees was marginal.[382][383] The club also maintained a large youth department which at one point cost about 400,000 Deutsche Mark per year.[382] At the end of 1996, the club still had no debts, but also no money left in its bank accounts.[296] President Wanski would then have to support the club with his own financial contributions.[296] It is estimated that Wanski invested an estimated 3 million Deutsche Mark of private money in the club over the five years before his resignation.[384] BFC Dynamo finally got a promising new sponsor in the form of Lipro AG in early 2000. Millions of Deutsche Mark would now be available.[385] But the club\'s liabilites had already started to become significant.[385] The club made a bid to reach the third tier Regionalliga Nord, and sports director Hans Reker started signing new players.[385] However, the millions from sponsor Lipro AG would later turn out to be loans.[385]\\n\\nThe emergency board was considered to represent the interest of the sponsor group around Wanski.[386] André Sommer and Rayk Bernt were controversial due to their membership in the Hells Angels.[387] However, both were also long-time supporters; Sommer had been a member of the hooligan scene back in the 1980s.[388][389] Zimmermann resigned from the emergency board on 23 November 2001, as he thought Sommer and Berndt had given the club an image he could not identify with.[390] A new presidium was due to be elected at a general meeting on 26 November 2001.[337] But the general meeting was converted into an \\\"information event\\\" by a vote of 87 to 59, at the insistence of the emergency board.[390][391] Some club members felt they had been blackmailed.[391] Sommer and Bernt continued to lead the club during the opening of the insolvency proceedings, but the legitimacy of their presidium was questioned.[390]\\n\\nInsolvency proceedings were opened on 1 November 2001.[392][393][394] BFC Dynamo was thus automatically relegated to the Verbandsliga Berlin.[372] All contracts with professionals and employees were terminated.[372][395][396][393] The club now had to continue under amateur conditions, the players could only be offered 300 Euros per month.[369][337] Only three players from the original squad remained for the first mandatory friendly match, one of them was team captain Piotr Rowicki.[397][337] Jörn Lenz left for VfB Leipzig and Nico Thomaschewski for SV Babelsberg 03.[337] Coach Jürgen Bogs also decided not to continue.[374][398] Former assistant coach Mario Maek stepped in as the new coach on a voluntary basis, assisted by goalkeeping coach Bodo Rudwaleit.[398] The club once again had to rely on its youth players.[399]\\n\\nSommer and Bernt met great opposition due to their membership in the Hells Angels.[400] The duo had a deterrent effect and failed to attract new sponsors.[388][401] Supporters collected signatures to elect a new presidium.[388][402] But the signatures were ignored by Sommer and Berndt.[388][402] The former coach of the women\'s team Volkmar Lucius then took legal action for violation of the statutes.[388][402] The Sommer and Bernt presidium was then finally overthrown by supporters and Lucius, through a successful application to the Charlottenburg District Court.[388][402][401] The court appointed Lucius as an emergency board member on 30 April 2002.[388][403] Sommer and Bernt had, after all, helped make sure that the insolvency proceedings could be opened by their personal financial contributions.[402][404] But the duo would no longer have much say in the club after 2003.[405] The interest group IG BFC\'er managed to persuade entrepreneur Mike Peters to become the new club president.[401][404] Peters was elected as the new president on 31 May 2002.[406] The preferential claims of 204,000 Euros looked insurmountable.[401] But the supporters had negotiated with creditors and received numerous waivers.[401][407] They had also set up a donations account and collected at least 13,800 Euros themselves.[407][406] The new presidum around Peters would also contribute 100,000 Euros from private money to the insolvency plan.[406][401][407] Peters also committed to funding a large part of the budget for the 2002-03 Verbandsliga Berlin.[406][408]\\n\\nRestart in Verbandsliga Berlin and end of insolvency (2002–2004)\\nFormer BFC Dynamo player Dirk Vollmar became the new coach for the 2002–03 season.[406] Bodo Rudwaleit continued as assistant coach.[406] Nico Thomaschewski and Aka Adeck Mba returned for the 2002–03 season.[409][410] The team was also joined by defender Robert Rudwaleit from the reserve team.[411][408][412] Robert Rudwaleit was the son of Bodo Rudwaleit and had made his first few appearances with the first team during the previous season.[413] BFC Dynamo defeated the reserve team of 1. FC Union Berlin in both meetings in 2002-03 Verbandsliga Berlin.[414] The team eventuallty finished its first season in the Verbandsliga Berlin in third place.[414] The insolvency situation was complex. The club had about 170 creditors. It was still unclear whether the insolvency proceedings could be successful.[415]\\n\\nJörn Lenz returned to the club for the 2003–04 season.[416] BFC Dynamo also recruited striker Danny Kukulies from SC Pfullendorf for the season. Kukulies had a long background in the youth department of BFC Dynamo.[417] BFC Dynamo was in third place after the first half of the season, nine points behind BFC Preussen and six points behind second placed SV Tasmania Gropiusstadt 73.[418] The team defeated SV Tasmania Gropiusstadt 73 2–1 in the first league match after the winter break, with one goal by Lenz and one goal by Robert Rudwaleit.[419] The team would also win the following matches.[420] BFC Dynamo eventually finished the 2003-04 Verbandsliga Berlin in first place and won promotion back to the NOFV-Oberliga Nord. The team had won all 17 matches in the second half of the league season, which set new record in the Verbandsliga Berlin.[421] Danny Kukulies scored 32 goals and Tomasz Suwary 22 goals in the 2003-04 Verbandsliga Berlin.[422] The insolvency proceedings would finally come to a positive conclusion after a meeting with the creditors at the Charlottenburg District Court on 8 June 8, 2004. The 192 creditors received an insolvency rate of 0.25 percent.[423][422] The insolvency proceedings were then finally declared closed by the Charlottenburg District Court on 16 June 2004, after one complaint was dismissed.[424]\\n\\nConsolidation, Regionalliga Nordost and Berlin Cup success (2004-present)\\nMain article: History of Berliner FC Dynamo (2004–present)\\nConsolidation (2004-2010)\\nMario Weinkauf was elected as new club president at the annual meeting on 18 June 2004. His vision for BFC Dynamo was a club that was \\\"managed seriously from a sporting and financial perspective\\\".[425][426] Former professional player Christian Backs became the new coach for the 2004–05 season.[427] Central players in the team in the 2004–05 season were Robert Rudwaleit, Nico Thomaschewski, Dennis Kutrieb, Jörn Lenz, Danny Kukulies and Tomasz Suwary.[428][429] There were several outbreaks of riots and hooliganism among the supporters of BFC Dynamo during the season.[430][431] The club management decided not to apply for a license to the Regionalliga Nordost despite the team being in third place in the league at the start of the second half of the season. The financial consolidation was not yet complete.[432] Coach Backs left for Berliner AK 07 before the end of the season due to financial disagreements with the club.[433] BFC Dynamo finished its first season in the NOFV-Oberliga Nord since its return in sixth place.\\n\\nFormer FC Vorwärts Frankfurt player Jürgen Piepenburg took over as new coach for the 2005–06 season.[434] Jens-Uwe Zöphel also returned to the club. BFC Dynamo was debt-free ahead of the 2005–06 season.[435] BFC Dynamo negotiated a lucrative sponsorship agreement with the energy company United Sol Energy. The company\'s representative in Berlin was the Belgian former FC Bayern Munich goalkeeper Jean-Marie Pfaff.[436][435][437] The plan also included the founding of a new youth sports school at BFC Dynamo that would bear Pfaff\'s name.[437] New riots broke out among supporters in connection with the match against SV Yeşilyurt on first matchday of the 2005-06 NOFV-Oberliga Nord on 5 August 2005. As many as 13 police officers were injured in the riots.[438][439] The 2005-05 NOFV-Oberliga Nord involved new derbies against 1. FC Union Berlin.

Coach Piepenberg was dismissed after the match.[442]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo came to play with the logo of United Sol Energy on their shirts at the beginning of the season, despite the fact that the club had yet to receive any money.[443][444] It eventually became clear that there would be no money from United Sol Energy.[445][446] Club spokesman Yiannis Kaufmann resigned from all posts in September 2005 due to disagreements over the club\'s policy regarding sponsors.

The anniversary was celebrated with a party for supporters with 750 guests.[452] The club management worked to ensure that the club would no longer be associated with hooligans and the far-right scene. The Israeli fashion brand JetLag became a new sponsor at the turn of the year and Weinkauf also planned a training camp in Israel.[453] The club decided not to extend the sponsorship agreements with several controversial sponsors at the beginning of 2006. The index included companies with links to Hells Angels.[453] The return match against 1. FC Union Berlin in the 2005-06 NOFV-Oberliga Nord was played in front of 6,647 spectators at the Stadion im Sportforum on 13 May 2006.[454][455] The score was 1-1, when abound 200 supporters of BFC Dynamo invaded the pitch to storm the guest block.[456] The match was abandoned and 1.

FC Lokomotive Leipzig after the 2017–18 season.[574][512]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo recruited Chris Reher from FC Viktoria 1889 Berlin for the 2018-season.[575] Five regular players were out with injuries at the beginning of the season.[576] BFC Dynamo faced 1. FC Köln from the Bundesliga in the first round of the 2018-19 DFB-Pokal. The match was played at the Olympiastadion, as the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark was not available due to the 2018 World Para Athletics European Championships.[576] Patrik Twardzik made it 1-0 for BFC Dymamo in the 19th minute, but 1. FC Köln would dominate the match. BFC Dynamo eventually lost 1–9. The match was attended by 14,357 spectators, which was a new record for BFC Dynamo since the fall of the Berlin Wall.[577][578] Matthias Maucksch took over as new coach during the winter break.[579] BFC Dynamo finished the 2017-18 Regionalliga Nordost in 12th place. Maucksch left his position after the season, due to disagreements with BFC Dynamo about the future plans of the club.[580]\\n\\nSuccess in Regionalliga Nordost (2019-pesent)\\n\\nThe mascot of BFC Dynamo \\\"Teddy\\\" at the Olympiastadion during the match between BFC Dynamo and 1.

FC Magdeburg before the season.[585] The pre-season friendly against 1. FC Magdeburg was then a tradition since 12 years back.[585] The team was in fifth place before the winter break.[586] The league season was suspended at the beginning of the second half, due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. The virtual match was played at the no longer existing Stadion der Weltjugend.[587] BFC Dynamo arranged a virtual match against the fictional team FC Corona on 18 April 2020, to raise funds.[588] The club sold a total of 50,000 tickets for the match.[589] The 2019-20 regionaliga Nordost was eventually cancelled. The final league standing was decided by quotient rule. BFC Dynamo finished in sixth place. The team was joined by midfielder Alexander Siebeck from SV Babelsberg 03 for the 2020–21 season.[590] Mathias Steinborn also returned to the club.[591] Also the 2020-21 Regionalliga Nordost was suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[592][593] The team lost several players during the break. Also the 2020-21 Regionalliga Nordost was ultimately cancelled, and FC Viktoria 1889 Berlin was declared the winner.[594]\\n\\nHowever, the Berlin Football Association (BFV) decided that the 2020-21 Berlin Cup should be played out played out among the five remaining Regionalliga teams.[595][596] BFC Dynamo defeated the newly promoted FC Viktoria Berlin 3–0 in the semi-finals.[597] The team then defeated Berliner AK 07 2–1 in the final at the Mommsenstadion on 29 May 2021 and captured its seventh Berlin Cup title.[598] BFC Dynamo was joined by experienced center forward Christian Beck and Moldovan goalkeeper Dmitri Stajila for the 2021–22 season.[599][600] Central central players in the team were Christian Beck, Dmitri Stajila, Chris Reher, Alexander Siebeck, Michael Blum, Andreas Pollasch, Joey Breitfeld, Darryl Guerts and Andor Bolyki during the 2021–22 season. The team defeated 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig 1–4 away in the opening match and then FC Energie Cottbus 2–1 at home on the second matchday of the 2021-22 Regionaliga Nordost.[601][602][603] BFC Dynamo was drawn against VfB Stuttgart in the first round of the 2021-22 DFB-Pokal. The match was played at Stadion im Sportforum. It was the first match in the DFB-Pokal at the Stadion im Sportforum since FC Berlin faced SC Freiburg at the stadium on 27 July 1991 in the 1991-92 DFB-Pokal.[270] BFC Dynamo lost the match 0–6 and was eliminated from the cup.[604] The team defeated VSG Altglienicke 2–0 at home on the 19th matchday and then Berliner AK 07 1–3 away on the 18th matchday. BFC Dynamo finished finished the first half of the league season as Herbstmeister.[605][606][607]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo saw the biggest increase in the number of club members among all clubs in Berlin in 2021, apart from Hertha BSC and 1. FC Union Belin. Membership of the club increased by 51 percent in 2021.[608] The team was joined by experience defender Sebastian Hertner during the winter break.[609][610] BFC Dynamo defeated Chemnitzer FC 1–3 away on the 31st matchday.[611] The team was now ten points ahead of second-placed VSG Altglienicke, as well as 11 points ahead of third-placed 1. FC Lokomotiv Lepzig and fourth-placed FC Carl Zeiss Jena. Afterwards, however, declining results followed. BFC Dynamo were six points behind second-placed FC Carl Zeiss Jena with two matchdays remaining, but the team had the best goal difference in the league by far.[612] FC Carl Zeiss Jena only had a theoretical chance to push BFC Dynamo off the top.[613] BFC Dynamo eventually finished the 2021-22 Regionaliga Nordost in first place and had finally captured its first ever Regionalliga title.[614] Christian Beck became the league top goalscorer with 23 goals.[615] The team faced VfB Oldenburg from Regionalliga Nord in the play-off for the 3. Liga.[614]\\n\\nIn order for BFC Dynamo to be able to get a license for the 3. Liga, the German Football Association (DFB) demanded that the club provide a massive guarantee of 900,000 Euros, as a security for the budget in the 3. Liga.[616] BFC Dynamo started a fundraiser to collect the amount. With the help of sponsors, supporters and Economic Council, the club managed to collect the amount.[617][618][619] BFC Dynamo lost the first play-off match 0–2 in front of 4,420 spectators at Sadion im Sportforum on 28 May 2022.[620] The second match was played at Marschweg-Stadion in Oldenburg on 4 June 2022. The score was 1–1 at half-time. Andor Bolyki finally managed to score 1-2 for BFC Dynamo in the 96th minute. BFC Dynamo tried everything, but failed to score a decisive third goal. The match ended 2–1 to BFC Dynamo, but VfB Oldenburg won the play-off on goal difference.[621][622] BFC Dynamo parted ways with coach Benbenneck after the season. The reason given was the stagnation at the end of the league season.[623] New coach for the 2022–23 season was Heiner Backhaus.[624]\\n\\nColours and crest\\nThe colours of BFC Dynamo are claret and white.[625] The colours were inherited from SC Dynamo Berlin and followed the claret colour scheme of SV Dynamo. BFC Dynamo has been playing in claret and white since the club\'s founding, with the exception of a period in the 1990s. The BFC Dynamo home kit has traditionally been a claret shirt, paired with claret or white shorts and socks. The team is occasionally nicknamed \\\"die Weinroten\\\", which means \\\"the Clarets\\\".[626][627]\\n\\nThe BFC Dynamo away kit has traditionally been a white shirt, paired with claret or white shorts and socks. However, the team used green away shirts from the end of the 1960s until the mid-1970s.[628][83] Green was the colour of the Volkspolizei, which was the official sponsor of BFC Dynamo during the East German era. The green away shirt was then exchanged for a white away shirt, paired with red or white shorts and socks.[93][99] The team used entirely red away kits during the 1981–82 and 1982–83 seasons.[629][630] The red away kit was then exchanged for a claret away kit.[631] The team again used white away shirts from the 1985–86 season.[632] The 1985–86 season also saw the instruction of a new claret and white diagonally striped away shirt.[632] The diagonally striped away shirt would be used for the rest of the 1980s.[237]\\n\\nThe club was rebranded as FC Berlin on 19 February 1990. A pure white was set as the new match colour with immediate effect.[633] FC Berlin then adopted a red and white colour scheme for the 1990–91 season.[634] In the eyes of the supporters, the red and white kit looked a lot like 1. FC Union Berlin.[634] The club played in red and white home kits for most of the FC Berlin era, but wore a black and red striped home shirt, paired with black shorts and socks from the 1996–97 season through the 1998–99 season. The club returned to its original club name on 3 May 1999 and consequently also later returned to its traditional colour scheme.[635]\\n\\n1966-1990, 1999–2009, 2023-\\n1966-1990, 1999–2009, 2023-\\n\\n \\n2009-2023\\n2009-2023\\n\\nThe crest of BFC Dynamo during the East German era featured a stylized \\\"D\\\" for SV Dynamo and the lettering \\\"BFC\\\" in red and yellow on a white background, surrounded by a yellow wreath.[636][637] BFC Dynamo abandoned its East German crest when the club was rebranded as FC Berlin on 19 February 1990.[638][639][636] The club used two different crests during the FC Berlin era. The first crest featured a stylized image of the roof of the Brandenburg Gate with the lettering \\\"FCB\\\" underneath and the club name \\\"Fussballclub Berlin\\\" in capital letters at the bottom, in white on a red background. It was only briefly used during the spring of 1990.[640] The second crest featured a stylized image of a football with the Brandenburg Gate in front, the lettering \\\"FCB\\\" at the top and the club name \\\"FC Berlin\\\" at the bottom, in red on a white background. This crest was used from the spring of 1990 until the end of the FC Berlin era.[640][284]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo reclaimed its East German crest when the club returned to its original club name on 3 May 1999.[639] But the club was no longer in possession of the crest.[639] The club had neglected to seek legal protection for its East German crest after German reunification. The neglect was likely due to managerial inexperience. Protection of trademarks was neither necessary nor common in East Germany.[636] The crest was now owned by Peter Klaus-Dieter Mager, commonly known as \\\"Pepe\\\". Pepe Mager was a famous fan of Hertha BSC and a fan merchandise dealer.[641] The club tried to recover the crest from Mager though court action, without success.[639][636] The ownership of the crest was instead passed on to Rayk Bernt and his company RA-BE Immobilien- und Handelsgesellschaft mbH.[479][642][643]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo continued to use the disputed crest on its kits and webpage. But the club would have to ask the owner of the crest every time it wanted to have a pennant made and was unable to exploit the commercial value of the crest for its own benefit.[479][516] The legal situation around the crest would also have caused problems in the event of an advance to the Regionalliga, as the German football Association (DFB) required clubs to own their crests.[517] In order establish independence, the club finally decided to adopt a new crest in 2009.[467]\\n\\nThe new crest abandoned the traditional stylized \\\"D\\\" and the lettering \\\"BFC\\\", as they would have met legal obstacles.[643] The new crest featured a black Berlin bear on claret and white stripes, together with the club name and the founding year.[643] The first version of the new crest sparked controversy. The word \\\"fußball\\\" in the club name had been written in lower case with a double \\\"s\\\" instead of the graphene \\\"ß\\\".[643] This was contrary to German spelling rules, where it is only permissible to write \\\"fußball\\\" with a double \\\"s\\\" when the word is written in upper case. Club President Norbert Uhlig ensured that there was absolutely no ulterior motive behind the spelling and claimed that the word had always been spelled like that on club pennants and scarfs.[643] The Chairman of the Economic Council Peter Meyer later claimed that the spelling was a deliberate marketing ploy, in order to have new crest immediately known across Germany.[643] A second version of the crest was soon made public, where the club name was written in upper case. The new crest was used by BFC Dynamo from the 2009–10 season.[516]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo finally managed win back the traditional crest in 2022, through the Chairman of the Economic Council Peter Meyer. Meyer had acquired the rights to the crest through one of his companies.[644] From the 2023–24 season, BFC Dynamo is once again playing with its traditional crest. The traditional crest was displayed for the first time since its reintroduction in a friendly match against Hertha BSC in front of more than 10,000 spectators at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark on 7 July 2023.[645][646]\\n\\nOwnership of the traditional crest\\nMany clubs in East Germany rushed to drop their East German names during the Peaceful revolution. BFC Dynamo was among the clubs to do so, in an attempt to distance the club from the Stasi.[639][250] The club was rebranded as FC Berlin on 19 February 1990 and consequently abandoned its East German crest.\\n\\nPepe Mager was a famous fan of Hertha BSC and fan merchandise dealer.[641] Mager had organized away trips for the fans Hertha in the early 1960s and was one of the founders of the notorious supporter group \\\"Hertha-Frösche\\\". He now sold his own fan merchandise from a mobile stand outside the Olympiastadion.[641][647][648] Mager inquired with the register of associations in Charlottenburg in 1991 about all deleted names of East German clubs.[641] He immediately found BFC Dynamo and saw business opportunities.[641][639] Mager claimed that he first secured the former crest of BFC Dynamo for 80 D-Marks in 1992.[381][643]\\n\\nThe name FC Berlin never became popular with the fans.[250] Fans continued to identify themselves with the former name and crest.[639] An overwhelming majority voted for the club to take back its original club name at the general meeting on 3 May 1999.[635] Of the 135 present, 125 voted in favor, three against and seven abstained.[309] BFC Dynamo thus reclaimed its East German crest, but the rights to the crest now belonged to Mager.[639] Mager had registered the crest in his name at the German Patent and Trademark Office on 13 May 1997.[639][649][636]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo contacted Mager for a co-operation, but an agreement could not be reached.[641][649] Mager held the opinion that the club should buy its merchandise from him, or simply buy the rights to the crest.[639] He later informed the club that he had received interest from foreign buyers and offered the club to buy the rights.[649] He claimed that the crest was worth 200,000 D-Marks.[639] BFC Dynamo on the other hand claimed that the crest should legally belong to the club. The club sued Mager in court on 20 November 2000, but eventually lost the case.[639][636] The club decided to suspend the legal dispute with Mager in the summer of 2001 and instead wanted to find a solution outside court.[650] Mager was repeatedly exposed to minor threats from the environment around BFC Dynamo and eventually sold the crest to Rayk Bernt and his company RA-BE Immobilien- und Handelsgesellschaft mbH for a price of 50,000 D-Marks in June 2002.[479][642][517][651]\\n\\nBernt was a close associate of André Sommer.[652] Bernt and Sommer had assisted the club at the opening of the insolvency proceedings in 2001–2002.[652][453][479] Both were long time fans of BFC Dynamo.[653][479][642] But the duo was controversial for their connections to Hells Angels.[653][652] Bernt and Sommer were almost as restrictive towards the club when it came to the crest as Mager had been. Bernt organized the production of fan merchandise in his own regime.[642] The club would have to ask his company every time it wanted to have a pennant made.[479] Bernt and Sommer usually agreed, manufactured the pennant and then sold it at their own fan merchandise stand at the stadium.[479] BFC Dynamo continued to use the crest and would at times be given ten percent of the revenues from their sales.[453][479][642][643] The club eventually offered 5,000 Euros for the crest, but was turned down.[453] Sponsor Peter Meyer was also said to have offered 150,000 euros for the buyback.[478] Bernt demanded a seven-digit sum, according to former Club President Mario Weinkauf.[453] The lawyer representing RA-BE Immobilien- und Handelsgesellschaft mbH allegedly claimed the crest was worth around 600,000 Euros at the time.[654]\\n\\nPresident Weinkauf planned to recover the rights to the former crest with the help of Thomas Thiel and the company Treasure AG before the general meeting on 23 June 2007. Thiel was a co-owner of Treasure AG, which was intended as a new major sponsor.[479] Bernt sold parts of the rights to the former crest to Thiel.[655] The price was allegedly a six-digit sum.[479][643] According to the plan, the club would be given the rights of use to the crest. The profits would thus go to the club. The club would pay a symbolic sum of 1 Euro per month for the rights of use. BFC Dynamo would then have a right of first refusal after the ten-year contract had expired and thus have the opportunity to eventually acquire ownership of the crest.[479][656] However, Weinkauf was ultimately rejected by club members in a vote of no-confidence at the general meeting on 23 June 2007.[485] Weinkauf would then be contacted by the former president of Tennis Borussia Berlin Peter Antony. Treasure AG became a sponsor of Tennis Borussia Berlin instead and Weinkauf would later become president of the club.[480]\\n\\nThiel sold his rights to the crest back to Bernt and his company BFC Dynamo Vermarktungsgesellschaft m.b.H in 2009.[657] The rights to the old crest where subsequently controlled again by the company RA-BE Immobilien- und Handelsgesellschaft mbH.[658][659] The company is controlled by Bernt, who sold occasional items with the former crest at his own webpage.[638] However, RA-BE Immobilien- und Handelsgesellschaft mbH transferred its rights to company AXXON AG in 2022.[660][661] In connection with the club\'s 57th anniversary in 2023, the Chairman of the Economic Council Peter Meyer revealed in an exclusive interview with Berliner Kurier that he had acquired the rights to the crest for the club through one of his companies. After more than 13 years, the traditional crest was finally back with the club. According to Berliner Kurier and Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk (MDR), a six-digit sum is said to have become due.[644][662]\\n\\nChampionship star\\nThe German Football League (DFL) introduced a system of championship stars in the 2004–05 season. The system was meant to honor the most successful teams in the Bundesliga by allowing teams to display stars on their shirts for the championships they have won. The system awarded one star for three titles, two stars for five titles, and three stars for ten titles.[663] However, the system only counted titles won in the Bundesliga since the 1963–64 season.[664][665][666]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo submitted an application to the DFL and the DFB on 9 August 2004 to receive three stars for its ten titles in the DDR-Oberliga. The club asked for equal rights and argued that the German Football Association (DFB) had absorbed the German Football Association of the GDR (DFV) with all its statistics, international matches and goal scorers.[663][667][668][664] BFC Dynamo received support from Dynamo Dresden and 1. FC Magdeburg in its attempts to achieve recognition for East German titles.[667][664]\\n\\nThe DFL responded that it was not the responsible body, but the DFB remained silent for a long time.[665] The DFB eventually declared itself responsible and recommended BFC Dynamo to submit a formal application for a new title symbol in accordance with a relevant paragraph.[664][665] BFC Dynamo commissioned a law firm in Mitte in January 2005 and sent a new letter to the DFB. The DFB announced that the application from BFC Dynamo was going to be negotiated in a meeting with the DFB presidium.[665] The meeting with the DFB presidium on 18 March 2005 agreed that all titles won in East Germany, as well all others titles won in Germany since the first recognized championship in 1903, should qualify for stars.[669] However, the decision was subject to approval by the DFL.[670] No final decision had yet been made by the DFB presidium.[671][672][673][674]\\n\\n\\nBFC Dynamo is allowed to wear one star inscribed with the number ten for its ten East German championships.\\nHowever, BFC Dynamo took matters in its own hands and unilaterally emblazoned its shirts with three stars.[672] The team displayed the three stars for first time in the match against FC Energie Cottbus II on 25 March 2005.[672] The claim by BFC Dynamo was controversial because the club had been the favorite club of Erich Mielke and had had a connection to the Stasi during the East German era.[672][673][675][676][666] Critics in the DFB environment pointed to politically influenced championships in East Germany. BFC Dynamo had been sponsored by the Stasi and had enjoyed advantages.[665] The club had privileged access to talents and a permanent training camp at Uckley in Königs Wusterhausen. However, also other clubs in East Germany had enjoyed similar advantages, which put the DFB in a difficult situation.[665] Also former East German referee and CDU parliamentarian Bernd Heynemann spoke out for recognition of all East German titles.[666]\\n\\nThe DFL rejected the application from the DFB and recommended the DFB to only honor clubs that were champions in the Bundesliga.[677] However, the DFB chose to not follow the recommendation. The DFB presidium instead decided on a compromise solution on 19 July 2005 and adopted a new regulation for the 2005–06 season which gave all clubs the right to wear one single star for the championships they have won in the former East Germany and in Germany since 1903. Clubs were also allowed to indicate the number of championships they have won in the center of the star.[678][679][680] The regulation only applies to clubs playing in a league under the DFB umbrella. It does not apply to clubs playing in the 2. Bundesliga and Bundesliga, which are organized by the DFL.[679]\\n\\nThe new regulation meant that BFC Dynamo was finally allowed to emblazon its shirts with a championship star. The regulation also affected other former East German teams including Dynamo Dresden with its eight titles, 1. FC Frankfurt with its six titles and Magdeburg with its three titles in the Oberliga.[665][680] BFC Dynamo has since then used the championship star in accordance with DFB graphic standards, displaying a star inscribed with the number ten for its ten East German titles.[681]\\n\\nStadiums\\nMain article: Stadion im Sportforum\\nThe long-time home and training facility of BFC Dynamo is the Sportforum Hohenschönhausen in Alt-Hohenschönhausen in Berlin. The sports complex is the location of the club offices and the clubhouse.[637] It is also the base of the youth teams.[637] More than 20 youth teams of BFC Dynamo regularly train at the facilities.[682] The Sportforum Hohenschönhausen is considered the spiritual home of the club.[637]\\n\\nThe Sportforum Hohenschönhausen was known as the Dynamo-Sportforum during the East German era.[683] The sports complex was built as a training center for elite sport and was home to sports club SC Dynamo Berlin, with its many departments and squads.[684][685] Development began in 1954 and expansion continued into the 1980s.[686] The Sportforum is still unique as of today.[687] The sports complex covers an area of 45 to 50 hectares and comprises 35 sports facilities as of 2020.[684][687][688][689]\\n\\n\\nA match between SC Dynamo Berlin and SC Turbine Erfurt at the Walter-Ulbricht-Stadion in 1959.\\nSC Dynamo Berlin played its first season at the large Walter-Ulbricht-Stadion in Mitte.[17][690] The team moved its home matches to the football stadium in the Dynamo-Sportforum for the short transitional 1955 season.[691] SC Dynamo Berlin returned to the Walter-Ulbricht-Stadion for the 1956 season.[690] The team would play at the Walter-Ublricht-Stadion for the rest of the 1950s.[690]\\n\\nSC Dynamo Berlin eventually moved its home matches permanentely to the Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum after the construction of the Berlin wall began on 13 August 1961.[17][692] The football stadium in the Dynamo-Sportforum held a capacity of 10,000 spectators at the beginning of the 1961–62 season.[683][nb 8] The team drew average attendances between 3,000 and 6,000 spectators in the DDR-Oberliga at the Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum in the 1960s.[704][705] The highlights were matches against local rival ASK Vorwärts Berlin and the various top teams during the period. The capacity of the football stadium in the Dynamo-Sportforum was gradually expanded during the 1960s.[692][nb 9]\\n\\n\\nA match between BFC Dynamo and BSG Chemie Leipzig at the Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum in 1966.\\nBFC Dynamo began playing occasional matches that required floodlights at the larger Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark in Prenzlauer Berg from November 1968.[692] The Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark was the home ground of FC Vorwärts Berlin at the time. However, the stadium became vacant when FC Vorwärts Berlin was relocated to Frankfurt an der Oder on 31 July 1971.[63] BFC Dynamo played its home matches in the 1971-72 European Cup Winners\' Cup at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark.[708] The matches against Åtvidabergs FF in the quarter-finals on 22 March 1972 and FC Dynamo Moscow in the semi-finals on 5 April 1972 were each attended by 30,000 spectators.[709][710] The team also played two home matches in the 1971-72 DDR-Oberliga at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark.[711] However, more matches at the stadium were not possible after the summer of 1972, as the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark was then undergoing extensive renovation for the upcoming 10th World Festival of Youth and Students.[690]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo was qualified for the 1972-73 UEFA Cup. However, neither the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark nor the Walter-Ulbricht-Stadion were available for the upcoming UEFA Cup matches. Both were undergoing extensive renovation for the 10th World Festival of Youth and Students. Instead, the Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum underwent a complete transformation in just five weeks between the end of July 1972 and September 1972.[690] The capacity of the Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum was now expanded to 20,000 spectators.[712][713][692] BFC Dynamo played all home matches in the 1972-73 UEFA Cup at the Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum. The attendance of 20,000 spectators during the match against Liverpool on 29 November 1972 is still a record attendance for the stadium.[696] BFC Dynamo remained at the Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum for a couple more seasons. The team saw rising attendance numbers at the Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum during the 1970s.[714] An average of 12,000 people attended the last six matches of BFC Dynamo at the Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum in the second half of the 1973–74 season.[692] The match between BFC Dynamo and 1. FC Magdeburg in the 1974-75 DDR-Oberliga at the Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum on 8 March 1975 was attended by a whole 19,000 spectators.[715]\\n\\n\\nA match between BFC Dynamo and SG Dynamo Dresden in front of 25,000 spectators at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark in 1976.[716]\\nBFC Dynamo eventually moved its home matches to the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark for the 1975–76 season, due to upcoming repair work at the Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum.[692] The move was meant to be temporary, but eventually became permanent.[692] The Dynamo-Sportforum would primarily serve as a training facility from then and the football stadium would be used mostly by the reserve team BFC Dynamo II. The Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark held a capacity of 30,00 spectators in the 1975–76 season.[708] The average home attendance of 16,538 spectators for BFC Dynamo at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Stadion in the 1975-76 DDR-Oberliga is the highest average league attendance in club history.[17][717] BFC Dynamo celebrated nine of its ten DDR-Oberliga titles in the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Stadium. The team also played most of its home matches in the UEFA competitions at the stadium. BFC Dynamo hosted teams such as Shakhtar Donetsk, Red Star Belgrade, Nottingham Forest, Hamburger SV, Aston Villa, AS Roma FC Aberdeen at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Stadium in the 1970s and 1980. However, all matches in the derby against 1. FC Union Berlin were played at the neutral Stadion der Weltjugend from the 1976–77 season for security reasons.[294][718][719][720]\\n\\nA permanent training camp for BFC Dynamo was built in Uckley in the Zernsdorf district of Königs Wusterhausen in Bezirk Potsdam at the end of the 1960s.[721] It was located in the woods and completely sealed off from the surroundings.[721][722] The training camp covered an area of around 10 hectares.[722] The complex was equipped with a boarding school, several football pitches, a sports hall, a swimming pool, a fitness area and a sauna.[723][724][725][722][726] The team would gather in Uckley days before its European matches.[17] The players would have access to catering facilities, a nearby lake, a bowling alley, a cinema and pinball machines, among other things.[725][726]\\n\\n\\nThe team of BFC Dynamo in front of the new grandstand of the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark in 1987.\\nBFC Dynamo moved its home matches temporary to the Dynamo-Sportforum for the 1986–87 season, as the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark was undrgoing redevelopment during the season for the upcoming 750th anniversary of Berlin.[692][708] The team also played its home matches in the 1986-87 European Cup at the Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum. The team then returned to the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark for the 1987–88 season.[727] The Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark now had a new four storey grandstand and new floodlight masts. The current grandstand and the floodlights of the stadium dates from this time.[696] The club was rebranded as FC Berlin after Die Wende. FC Berlin moved permanently to the Stadion im Sportforum at the beginning of the 1992–93 season.[696] The team would remain in the Sportforum Hohenschönhausen for many seasons to come.[692]\\n\\nThe capacity of the Stadion im Sportforum had been reduced to about 12,000 spectators by 1992.[692] FC Berlin only drew an average of a couple of hundred spectators per match at the Stadion im Sportforum in the mid-1990s. The highlights were the matches against 1. FC Union Berlin. FC Berlin under Club President Volkmar Wanski announced plans in April 1998 to buy and modernize the stadium.[300] However, the plans eventually failed due to lack of funds. The team saw rising attendance numbers at the Stadion im Sportforum at the end of the 1990s.[714] Active supporters of BFC Dynamo were traditionally found at the northern curved end, popularly known as the Nordwall stand.[717] 4,220 spectators watched the match between BFC Dynamo and Union Berlin at the Stadion im Sportforum on 23 November 1999.[728]\\n\\nSupporters of BFC Dynamo installed new bucket seats on the main stand and built a new clubhouse next to the main stand of the Stadion im Sportforum in 2002–2003.[729] The Stadion im Sportforum was then equipped with a 25-metre player tunnel and plexiglass-clad coaching benches in November 2004.[730] BFC Dynamo made new plans for a modern football stadium in the Sportforum Hohenschönhausen in 2006 under Club President Mario Weinkauf. The club now wanted to build a new modern stadium for 10,000–15,000 spectators.[731] However, these plans did not materialize either. The Stadion im Sportforum was closed at the end of the 2005–06 season following the riots during the match between BFC Dynamo and Union Berlin on 13 May 2006.[457] BFC Dynamo temporarily had to move to the Friedrich-Ludwg-Jahn-Sportpark.[461] The stadium was then refurbished in 2006–2007 to increase safety and meet the requirements of the NOFV.[487] The refurbishment included a new fence.[732]\\n\\n\\nA match between BFC Dynamo and SV Babelsberg 03 on 23 April 2017.\\nBFC Dynamo won promotion to the Regionalliga Nordost at the end of the 2013–14 season. The team moved permanently to the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark for the 2014–15 season, due to increased media and spectator interest following its promotion.[696][733] The 2014-15 Regionalliga Nordost meant matches against well-known opponents such as 1. FC Magdeburg and FC Carl Zeiss Jena. The more central location of the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark was seen by the club as an opportunity to attract more spectators.[733] The match between BFC Dynamo and 1. FC Magdeburg on 8 November 2014 was attended by 5,103 spectators.[734] Active supporters of BFC Dynamo have traditionally been found on the main stand, and on the side opposite the main stand (German: die Gegengerade) of the Friedrich Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark.[717] The match between BFC Dynamo and FC Schalke 04 in the first round of the 2018-19 DFB-Pokal at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark on 17 August 2017 was watched by 14,117 spectators.[570] The attendance was the highest attendance for BFC Dynamo since the fall of the Berlin wall.[570][86] The average league attendance of BFC Dynamo in the 2017-18 Regionalliga Nordost would also be the highest average league attendance of BFC Dynamo since the 1990-91 season.[705]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo had to play a number of matches at the Stadion im Sportforum at the end of the 2018–19 season due to safety issues relating to the dilapidated floodlights at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark.[735] The move was greeted by some supporters as a move to the true home of the club.[736] The club was then set to return to the Sportforum in the 2020–21 season as the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark was planned to be demolished for a complete redevelopment.[637] The team was allowed to continue play in the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark until 31 December 2020.[737] BFC Dynamo then officially announced on 21 March 2021 that the club was going to move back to the Sportforum Hohenschönhausen for the next season.[738]\\n\\nThe Stadion im Sportforum was equipped with a floodlight system in April 2021.[739][740] The club organized a work effort in the summer of 2021 to get the stadium in shape for the upcoming Regionalliga season. [741] Supporters of BFC Dynamo gathered and cleared sections of the old stadium from weeds.[742] Members of the interest group IG BFC\'er also restored the iconic manual scoreboard above the curved end towards the Weißenseer Weg in time for the first home match of the 2021–22 season against Energie Cottbus on 28 July 2021.[743] The attendance for BFC Dynamo at the Stadion im Sportforum in the 2021-22 Regionalliga Nordost was almost tripled compared to the last comparable league season before the COVID-19 pandemic. 3,219 people watched the match between BFC Dynamo and FC Carl Zeiss Jena on 10 April 2022.[744]\\n\\nFuture stadium\\nThe large stadium in the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark is planned to be demolished towards the end of 2023 for a complete redevelopment.[745] The new stadium im the Fredrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark is designed as an inclusive sports facility. The stadium will hold 20,000 spectators and meet the requirements for play in the 3. Liga and 2. Bundesliga.[746][747][745] BFC Dynamo will be able to play matches at the new stadium. The new stadium in the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark is planned to be opened in 2028.[748]\\n\\nSupporters\\nEast German era\\nBFC Dynamo played only a minor role in football in Berlin until the relocation of FC Vorwärts Berlin to Frankfurt an der Oder in 1971.[717] The club initially had modest support, but with its growing successes in the 1970s, the club began to attract young fans, primarily from the central areas around the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark, such as Prenzlauer Berg and Mitte.[174] Many came from working class families in Prenzlauer Berg.[749] One of the first big supporter groups of BFC Dynamo was Black Eagle. The fan club was founded in 1972 and was one of the earliest fan clubs in East German football. Fans of BFC Dynamo were the first to sew their embroidered fan club badges on their jackets. This was a novelty among football supporters in East Germany in the 1970s.[750]\\n\\nThe supporter scene became a focal point for various subcultures in the late 1970s and beginning of the 1980s.[751][520][752] There were punks, rockers, hippies and a few early skinheads.[751][717][753][754][137] Some were left-leaning and others were right-leaning.[751][754] Football and stadium life offered free spaces that were difficult for the authorities to control.[137] For some fans, being part of the supporter scene was an opportunity to rebel against the East German regime.[751] Most supporters of BFC Dynamo had little to do with the state. It was more important for them to protest, do their own thing and break out from everyday life.[717] Despite cheering for a club associated with the Stasi, supporters of BFC Dynamo were not loyal to the line.[751] Many active fans of BFC Dynamo in the 1980s were against the regime.[177][754] Some supporters would even cut out the \\\"D\\\" for SV Dynamo from their club patches. They considered the \\\"BFC\\\" to be free from the Stasi, while they thought the \\\"D\\\" symbolized the exact opposite.[755]\\n\\n\\\"We provoked with chants and slogans. We were right, left, punk, hippie, skinhead. We were direct and provocative, kind and evil, in love, or drunk. Cool words were always well received. Right or left, I don\'t want to classify one. We were all in our fan group against the GDR, rebellion!\\\"\\n\\n– A fan of BFC Dynamo in the 1980s[756]\\nYoung people were gradually attracted by the provocative image of the club: its successes, its reputation as a Stasi club and the hatred of opposing fans.[520][752] Some fans of BFC Dynamo found delight in the unpopularity of their club and took pride in the hatred they met.[754][757][32] One fan recalled that the 1980s \\\"were my greatest years, as we always had glorious success in provoking other fans\\\" and another one that \\\"we were really hated by everyone\\\".[757] Fans of BFC Dynamo would sometimes respond to the hatred they met by singing chants in praise of Erich Mielke as a provocation.[758] They would also throw tropical fruits, that were only available in East Berlin, at home fans during away matches in Saxony.[178][753]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo came to be associated with areas such as Prenzlauer Berg, Pankow, Weißensee, Hohenschönhausen and certain cafés and restaurants in vicinity of Alexanderplatz.[759][760] The supporter scene included groups such as Black Eagle, Norbert Trieloff, Bobbys, Iron Fist, Beatles BFC Club, Die Ratten, Berliner Wölfe, Heavy Horses, Black Pahnter and Madness boys of Preussen in the 1980s.[761] Fashion played a big role in the BFC Dynamo supporter scene.[32][754] Football supporters in East Berlin shared a sense of superiority over their counterparts in the regional districts.[760][751] This was also the case with the supporters of Union Berlin, but notably with the supporters of BFC Dynamo.[760][762][177][763]\\n\\nFootball-related violence spread in East Germany in the 1970s.[137][764] The supporter scene of BFC Dynamo was still young at the time, while clubs such Union Berlin and BSG Chemie Leipzig had large followings.[32] A trip to Leipzig or Dresden was a difficult task.[717] Supporters of BFC Dynamo responded to the hostile environment, and learned to compensate their smaller numbers, by being more aggressive and better organized.[765][174][32][766] The dislike against BFC Dynamo in stadiums around the country and the hatred of opposing fans welded its supporters together.[767] One fan of BFC Dynamo said: \\\"This feeling of being hated is what makes it so appealing.\\\" A saying among the supporters of BFC Dynamo was: \\\"We are few, but we are awesome!\\\" (German: Wir sind wenig, wir sind geil!)[768][32] One fan of BFC Dynamo recalled: \\\"It was really rumbling at away trips, and only then you felt your own strength. When we went with 200 people against 1,000 Unioners and you noticed: If you stick together, you have an incredible amount of violence.\\\"[769] Supporters of BFC Dynamo would eventually gain a reputation for being particularly violent and organized.[174] One fan of Union Berlin recalled: \\\"There was hardly an enemy mob against us, we were just too many... But the people who stood in the way of the violence-seeking BFC:ers were very few... The BFC:ers were completely organized. These hundred and fifty people, everyone knew each other. They stood as a block like a wall.\\\"[770] The book \\\"Riot Boys!\\\" by Jochen Schramm depicts the supporter scene of BFC Dynamo and contains stories of violent away trips in the early 1980s. Jochen \\\"Ellis\\\" Schramm was a member of the hooligan scene of BFC Dynamo in the 1980s.[771]\\n\\nThe development in the supporter scene of BFC Dynamo would eventually catch the attention of the authorities. The Stasi conducted a study on the violent structures of the supporter scene at the beginning of the 1980s. It found that 80 percent of those committing violent acts were 16–25 years old. Most of them were workers or students.[760] It also found that 20 percent came from families of the socialist intelligentia.[177][760] The Stasi assigned a group of two full-time officers from the district administration to the supporter scene during 1982–83 season.[772] From then, supporters of BFC Dynamo were accompanied, observed and documented.[773] This was a measure that had previously also been applied to the supporter scene of Union Berlin.[178] The authorities had allegedly been particularly alarmed when supporters of BFC Dynamo unfurled a poster in memory of Lutz Eigendorf with the text \\\"Iron Foot, we mourn you!\\\" during a match at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark in April 1983.[774][773][174] Supporters had also started a fan club in honour of Eigendorf.[753] The Stasi would try to control the supporter scene with a broad catalogue of measures: persistent talks, intimidation attempts, reporting requirements and arrests.[717][751] It would also attempt to infiltrate the fan clubs by unofficial collaborators (IM).[772] All football fan clubs in East Germany had to undergo registration.[137] According to Stasi information, BFC Dynamo had six registered fan clubs and 22 unauthorized fan clubs in 1986. Unauthorized fan clubs were those that were unregistered or did not meet DFV guidelines.[775] East German state television always tryied to hide riots from viewers. But the sound recording from football matches was the biggest problem. Additional sound systems were integrated into the stadium of BFC Dynamo for radio and television broadcasts. The system was also supposed to drown out shouts and chanting from the violent structures, so that television viewers and radio listeners would not hear anything.[776]\\n\\nThe supporter scene of BFC Dynamo came to be increasingly associated with skinheads and far-right tendencies from the mid-1980s.[174] More and more supporters of BFC Dynamo began to embrace skinhead fashion in the early 1980s.[751][717] Skinhead fashion was now considered the most provocative outfit.[751] By the mid-1980s, the club had become one of the most popular football clubs in the growing skinhead movement.[32][nb 10] The reputation of BFC Dynamo as the hated Stasi club also attracted skinheads, who used the club as a stage for their provocations.[520] Right-wing slogans and fascist chants were considered as the most challenging provocations, as anti-fascism was state doctrine and Nazism officially did not exist in East Germany.[783][137][174][751][784][637] For young people, being a Nazi was sometimes considered the sharpest form of opposition.[785] However, instances of Nazi provocations did not necessarily reflect genuine political convictions. At least some part of the \\\"drift to the right\\\" among East German youth during the 1980s was rooted in a desire to position oneself wherever the state was not.[786] One fan of BFC Dynamo said: \\\"None of us really knew anything about politics. But to raise your arm in front of the Volkspolizei was a real kick. You did that and for some of them, their whole world just fell apart\\\".[787][717][174][nb 11]\\n\\nThe first East German hooligan group developed from the supporter scene of BFC Dynamo in the 1980s. The development was partly a response to the increasing state repression against the supporter scene, notably from the Stasi.[190] An organized hooligan scene with groups, structures and training rooms, that was unique in East Germany, would eventually emerge at BFC Dynamo.[766] The hooligans of BFC Dynamo initially reacted with restraint to police intervention in the fan block. There was a risk of going to jail. However, the Volkspolizei were sometimes ruthless, especially at away matches. Towards the end of the 1980s, there was an uprising and the hooligans of BFC Dynamo now began to confront the police with violence.[794] The final of the 1987-88 FDGB-Pokal between BFC Dynamo and Carl Zeiss Jena on 4 June 1988 saw some of the most serious violence ever witnessed at an East German football match.[4] A group of 100 to 150 skinheads and other hooligans marched through Pankow to the Stadion der Weltjugend for the match. They chanted fascist slogans and clashed with other supporters.[795][779] Riots then broke out in one of the blocks shortly before the end of the match. Supporters destroyed fences and threw seats at match stewards.[796] A group of 300 supporters of BFC Dynamo attempted to invade the pitch during the victory ceremony. They caused extensive damage to 60 seating benches.[786] About a year later, supporters of BFC Dynamo would also destroy large parts of a block of the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark, during the match against AS Monaco in the 1989–90 European Cup Winners\' Cup on 1 November 1989.[797][798][nb 12]\\n\\nGerman reunification\\nA wave of violence swept through the football stadiums of East Germany in 1990.[178] The collapse of the East German regime resulted in a security vacuum.[800][801][802] The Volkspolizei was overwhelmed by the amount of disorder and often reluctant to use enough force, due to the political situation.[803][178][804][264]\\n\\n\\nSupporters of FC Berlin during the away match against FC Carl Zeiss Jena on 8 April 1990.\\nMasked supporters of FC Berlin rioted in central Jena before the away match against FC Carl Zeiss Jena in the 1989-90 DDR-Oberliga on 8 April 1990. They broke shop windows, smashed windscreens of police vehicles with stones and left a trail of destruction in the city center. Supporters of FC Berlin also fired flares at police officers during the match.[805] The disorder at the stadium would not cease and the match was eventually interrupted.[32] The riots in Jena caught rare attention by East German state media, which until then had been generally silent about football related disorder.[32][751]\\n\\n\\nA flare thrown on the pitch during the match between FC Carl Zeiss Jena and FC Berlin on 8 April 1990.\\nThere were now riots now after every home match in FC Berlin. After the last home match in the 1989-90 NOFV-Oberliga against BSG Wismut Aue on 26 May 1990, a group of 300 supporters of FC Berlin marched from Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark towards Alexanderplatz. Windows were smashed, cars were damaged and a minibus was overturned as they made their way. Supporters met at the Marx-Engels-Forum. A group of 200 people then formed a human swastika in front of the Volkspolizei. There were 21 arrests, and the police seized knives, knuckle dusters and pepper spray.[806]\\n\\nHooligans who had left East Germany for various reasons in recent years rejoined the hooligan scene after the opening of the Berlin Wall.[265][807] Some were former skinheads who had been deported by the Stasi to West Germany in the late 1980s. Now they chanted things such as \\\"Who should be our Führer? Erich Mielke!\\\" as a provocative fun, to the dismay of the club.[265][804] Supporters who returned from West Germany also brought back a new fashion based on designer clothing labels and expensive sportswear, which was adopted by the supporter scene.[265][767] While combat boots and bomber jackets were now common at many places in East Germany, some supporters of BFC Dynamo wanted to differentiate themselves. Expensive sneakers was now the new fashion in the supporter scene.[717][807][808] Brands such as Diesel, Iceberg, Chevignon, Adidas, Best Company, New Balance and Ray Ban became popular.[767][265][808][760]\\n\\nThe reputation of the hooligans of FC Berlin attracted a large number of new young people who joined the hooligan scene.[265] A series of violence occurred in connection with the cup match between Union Berlin and FC Berlin in the Second round of the 1990-91 FDGB-Pokal on 23 September 1990. Hooligans of FC Berlin stormed the home stands of the Stadion an der Alten Försterei armed with clubs and flares and hunted down supporters of Union Berlin.[263][809] Riots broke out after match. Aound 250 hooligans threw gravel and other objects at the police. At least 14 police officers were injured in the clashes.[810] Serious riots then continued in the city, involving hundreds of supporters. Street battles broke out in areas of East Berlin, even spreading to Kreuzberg in West Berlin.[811] One supporter of FC Berlin said: \\\"In 1990, thanks to the many departures to the West, it became clear relatively quickly that there was no flowerpot to be won with the current team. We then turned our attention to other things.\\\"[812]\\n\\nHooligans in East Germany unleashed almost unbridled violence against the representatives of the disintegrating East German state.[802] Violent riots had occurred in Rostock, Dresden, Erfurt and East Berlin.[802] Police had been forced to shoot warning shots during violent riots in Leipzig and one match in the 1990-91 NOFV-Oberliga had already been abandoned due to riots in the stadium.[803][813][814][815][nb 13] The situation peaked during a match between FC Sachsen Leipzig and FC Berlin on 3 November 1990. Supporters of FC Berlin travelled in large numbers to Leipzig for the match.[802] The police had only 219 officers available for the match.[264] There were clashes at the Leipzig main railway station, with one police officer injured and 50 supporters taken into custody.[264][816] A first group of around 100 supporters of FC Berlin entered the Georg-Schwarz-Sportpark in time for kick-off.[802] They were joined by a hooligans of 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig, who had forced their way into the stadium.[817][818][819][777] Supporters of both camps tried to attack each other in the stadium and the police had difficulties in maintaining a buffer zone.[264] A second group of up to 400 supporters of FC Berlin arrived later at the nearby Leipzig-Leutzsch S-Bahn station at Am Ritterschlößchen street.[802][264] Fireworks were fired as they made their way to the stadium.[820] The group was blocked from entering the stadium by police equipped with helmets and shields, despite showing valid tickets.[821][822][265] The supporters were not given any reason.[820] They were then pushed back by the police using tear gas and truncheons.[802][264][821] The group returned to the S-Bahn station and made an attempt to reach the stadium from the Pettenkofer Straße instead.[802] They were again blocked by police who immediately used truncheons.[802][820]\\n\\nRiots broke out at the S-Bahn station.[802] The station building was vandalized and numerous cars were smashed or burned, including at least one W 50 police truck and one police car.[802][264][820][816] The police was allegedly outnumbered.[823][nb 14] Cobblestones were thrown at the police waiting at the Pettenkofer Straße.[802] The police now decided to use their firearms.[802] 18-year old supporter Mike Polley (de) from the locality of Malchow in Berlin was hit by several bullets and instantly killed.[265][807] He was allegedly about to bend down to a friend when hit.[826] Several others were injured and at least another three people were seriously injured.[801][264][821] One supporter of FC Berlin was hit in the head and suffered critical injuries, but survived.[265] The police had fired between 50 and 100 shots in about a minute, from 11 different police pistols.[264][821] Reports and sources vary on what happened on the scene and how the situation was.[264] The police claim that they were surrounded.[823] But this was rebuffed by an eyewitness.[820] Shots had been fired from distances as long as 30–40 meters.[264][820] The police had also fired at fleeing supporters.[820] One supporter was hit while trying to escape into an S-Bahn train.[820] Not every injured had come with the supporters of FC Berlin. Also an uninvolved woman was shot in the leg.[264]\\n\\nAfter the shootings, some supporters of FC Berlin left the S-Bahn station by train.[823] Many were shaken, but other wanted to take revenge.[820] A group of supporters stopped a tram, kicked the driver out and maneuvered it down town.[265][802] Riots now continued in central Leipzig, where policed presence was low.[820] The riots in central Leipzig continued for several hours and the damage was extensive.[265][802][777] Supporters of FC Berlin devastated entire streets.[823] All shop windows on the Nikolaistraße opposite the main railway station were broken.[816] There was rampage at the Park Hotel.[818][824] The ground floor of a department store on Brühl was destroyed.[824] Numerous cars were demolished and up to 31 shops were smashed and looted.[824][823][264] Supporters clashed with transport police at the main railway station. New shots were fired by the police, but no one was injured.[823][265][264]\\n\\n\\nSupporters of FC Berlin commemorate Mike Polley at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark, during the match against HFC Chemie in the 1990-91 NOFV-Oberliga on 10 November 1990.\\nMike Polley was considered a beginner in the supporter scene.[823] A demonstration against police violence with 1,000 participants was arranged in Prenzlauer Berg by supporters of FC Berlin after the match against HFC Chemie on 10 November 1990.[32][264][777] The demonstration was supported by the recently founded Fanprojekt Berlin.[264] Also professional FC Berlin players such as Waldemar Ksienzyk participated in the march.[257] The demonstration received support from politicians such as Lena Schraut from the Alternative List and from left-wing activists, notably from the occupied houses near Senefelderplatz at the Schönhauser Allee.[777][265] The friendly match between East Germany and West Germany that was planned to be held on the Zentralstadion in Leipzig on 21 November 1990 was cancelled for security reasons and due to the tense situation among football supporters after the shootings.[264][777] An investigation against ten police officers was opened, but closed in April 1992.[264][777] The exact circumstances around the death of Mike Polley were never fully clarified.[822][827]\\n\\nStadium attendance collapsed in 1990. Many supporters of BFC Dynamo stopped attending matches after the Peaceful revolution, as the best players were sold off to clubs in West Germany, sports performance slumped, tickets prices rose, mass unemployment spread and hooligans had come to dominate the stands.[178][801][637][828] Some shifted their focus to ice hockey instead.[829] The average league attendance of the 1990–91 NOFV-Oberliga was by far the lowest in the league history.[801] BFC Dynamo was hit particularly hard by the decline. Average league attendance at BFC Dynamo had dropped from 8,385 in the 1988–89 season to 1,076 in the 1990–91 season.[830][831][832] Ordinary supporters had disappeared. Only young supporters remained in the stadium at FC Berlin in 1990 and 1991.[178]\\n\\nThe violent faction of FC Berlin would come to shape the entire 1990–91 season.[265] Matches involving FC Berlin were all security matches.[264] A group of 500–600 supporters of FC Berlin travelled with a special train to Rostock for an away match against F.C. Hansa Rostock on 16 March 1991.[265][833] The police did not manage to control the situation despite a record strong presence of more than 600 officers.[833][834] Riots broke out in central Rostock, where supporters smashed shops, demolished cars and attacked people.[265][767][833] Supporters without tickets stormed the Ostseestadion and there were fights with supporters of F.C. Hansa Rostock around the stadium.[833] Riots at the train station after the match had to be suppressed by the police with tear gas and water cannons.[833][265] The damage was again extensive. Up to 17 shops at the Wismarischen Straße were smashed and looted, the train station was devastated and the special train was vandalized.[834] 21 people were injured in the clashes, including nine police officers.[835][836] The damages amounted to around 750,000 Deutsche Marks.[836] The Minister President of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern Alfred Gomolka believed the Stasi was behind the riots. He claimed that the hooligans of FC Berlin were controlled by \\\"Stasi remnants\\\" who wanted to cause \\\"destabilization\\\". Also the Interior Minister of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern Georg Diederich saw the riots as a political confrontation. As a proof, they pointed to the fact that supporters of FC Berlin came with East German flags and that the club had pre-financed the special train to Rostock.[835]\\n\\nThe youth television programme Elf99 on Deutscher Fernsehfunk (DFF) ran a special story on the hooligans of FC Berlin in August 1991. The story was called \\\"Elf-Spezial: Das randalierende Rätsel – Der Berliner Hooligans zwischen Wahn und Scham?\\\" and can be found on YouTube as of 2020.[837] About 200 supporters of FC Berlin traveled to the top match against Greifswalder SC 1926 in the 1991-92 NOFV-Oberliga Nord on 3 November 1991. Repeated riots broke out during the match. Supporters of FC Berlin claim they were insulted as \\\"Stasi-pigs!\\\" by spectators in Greifswald. Supporters of FC Berlin fought with other spectators and the stadium facilities were demolished in the riots.[838] Up to 100 hooligans of FC Berlin also attacked an asylum shelter that was located right next to the stadium in Greifswald.[839][840][788][841] SV Hafen Rostock 61 subsequently postponed its upcoming league match at home against FC Berlin for security reasons.[842][841]\\n\\nHooliganism\\nThe hooligan scene of FC Berlin at the beginning of the 1990s was considered the most notorious for years in Germany. Hooligans of FC Berlin were subsequently involved in numerous fights in stadiums, woods and meadows.[178] Organized fights with other hooligan groups began in 1992 and 1993.[265] However, hooligans of FC Berlin were also involved in fights with squatters and other left-wing groups in the 1990s.[265] 25 supporters of FC Berlin fought 40 people from the left-wing scene in front of a pub on the Straße der Pariser Kommune in Friedrichshain on 17 April 1995. Several people were injured.[843] A number of people allegedly associated with the hooligan scene of FC Berlin attacked formerly occupied houses and a meeting point for left-wing football supporters at Brunnenstraße 6 and 7 in Mitte on the night of 6 September 1997. A punk concert was held on the premises at the time. Four people had to be hospitalized with injuries.[844]\\n\\nIn the years after German reunification, the club\'s eternal outside image attracted people from the underground.[752] Playing for meager crowds in regional leagues, the club eventually became a meeting place for individuals from Berlin\'s far-right, hooligan and criminal underground.[637][845] By the mid-1990s, the hooligan scene of FC Berlin had developed a connection to the eastern Berlin bouncer scene.[387] The eastern Berlin bouncer scene would eventually be almost completely organized from the hooligan scene of BFC Dynamo.[799][846] One of those involved in the assault on French policeman Daniel Nivel during the 1998 FIFA World Cup had connections to the hooligan scene of FC Berlin.[637] The same man was later linked to organized crime and eventfully involved in a high-profile drug trafficking case.[847][848][637]\\n\\nThe match between BFC Dynamo and Berlin Türkspor 1965 in the final of the 1998–99 Berlin Cup on 11 May 1999 was marked by violence. Supporters of BFC Dynamo directed far-right chants and others provocations against Berlin Türkspor 1965 during the match.[849] 400 supporters of BFC Dynamo invaded the pitch after the final whistle to celebrate the title. Some supporters also attacked players of Berlin Türkspor 1965. Two players of Berlin Türkspor 1965 were injured, one of them had suffered a stab wound.[850] BFC Dynamo Club President Volkmar Wanski was able to prevent a total escalation by giving a calming speech over the stadium microphone.[851] He immediately apologized for the behavior of the supporters at the press conference after the match.[850] Older supporters of BFC Dynamo openly expressed their contempt for the far-right supporters that had visited the match.[852] BFC Dynamo and Berlin Türkspor 1965 agreed to meet in a friendly match later in the season and to organize a joint meal for players and responsible.[853] Wanski made it clear in the speakers ahead of the last home match against FC Rot-Weiß Erfurt in the 1998-99 Regionalliga Nordost on 15 May 1999 that \\\"anyone who cannot behave has no business in our stadium\\\".[854]\\n\\nSerious riots broke out in Prenzlauer Berg after the match between BFC Dynamo and 1. FC Union Berlin in the Round of 16 of the 2000–01 Berlin Cup at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark on 24 March 2001. Around 150 supporters of BFC Dynamo attacked the police after the match, as they wanted to storm the block of Union Berlin.[855][342] Around 500 supporters of BFC Dynamo then attacked police at Eberswalder Straße.[342] The police employed water cannons against supporters at Eberswalder Straße and Schönhauser Allee. Nine people, including four police officers, were injured.[855][342] BFC Dynamo Club President Karin Halsch (de) and 1. FC Union Berlin Club President Heiner Bertram criticized the police in unison for provocations during the match and for triggering riots.[341] Karin Halsch simultaneously expressed sadness that the riots destroyed a lot of reconstruction work in the club and announced that there would be many stadium bans.[341][856] Also coach Jürgen Bogs spoke out about \\\"senseless violence\\\" that would once again fall back on the club, but also criticized the police for provocations.[341] Many of those involved in the riots did not come from the supporter scene of BFC Dynamo. Many were visitors from other cities in Germany.[387]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo had the highest number of violent supporters in Germany in 2005.[857] Violence broke out during the match between Tennis Borussia Berlin and BFC Dynamo in the 2004-05 NOFV-Oberliga Nord at the Mommsenstadion on 11 February 2005. A flare was lit and a couple of bangers set off in the guest block at the beginning of the second half. Police then decided to intervene against away supporters. Police officers were pelted with beer cups and attacked by supporters of BFC Dynamo when they entered gest block. Eight police officers were injured and 11 supporters of BFC Dynamo arrested. BFC Dynamo criticized the police operation as \\\"disproportionate\\\".[858][431] Supporters of BFC Dynamo claimed that they had been called \\\"Nazis\\\", \\\"Ossis\\\" and \\\"Unioners\\\" by police officers. Riots had broken out also when Tennis Borussia Berlin played 1. FC Union Berlin in round of 16 of the 2004-05 Berlin Cup at the Mommsenstadion a couple of weeks before.[431]\\n\\nFighting between supporters of BFC Dynamo and police again broke out in connection with the match between BFC Dynamo and SV Yeşilyurt at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark on 24 April 2005. The mood had been tense during the match. The situation escalated when celebrating supporters of BFC Dynamo attacked the fence after the final whistle. Police intervened with water hoses, batons and tear gas against supporters of BFC Dynamo. Four police officers were injured and five hooligans arrested. One police officer suffered a broken nose and another one a concussion.[859][860] Riots again broke out in connection to a match between BFC Dynamo and SV Yeşilyurt at the opening of the 2005-06 NOFV-Oberliga Nord at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark 5 August 2005. The match was attended by 1,200 supporters of BFC Dynamo. Hooligans in the crowd threw bottles and stones at police officers during the match. Fights between hooligans and police then broke out after match. Around 150 hooligans had participated in the riots, according to police information.[861][438] BFC Dynamo spokesperson Yiannis Kaufmann claimed that those involved were a \\\"mob of travelling fans who wants to cause trouble everywhere and now discredit the BFC\\\".[861] As many as 13 police officers were injured in the riots.[439][440]\\n\\n\\nThe Stadion im Sportforum on 14 May 2006.\\nPolice made a controversial raid against the discotheque Jeton in Friedrichshain where supporters of BFC Dynamo and other people had gathered to celebrate in connection to a fan tournament in memory of Mike Polley on the night of 20 August 2005. The fan tournament had been visited by numerous teams, including teams from FC St. Pauli, 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig, Aberdeen F.C., VfL Bochum and Malmö FF.[862][863][864] The large-scale police operation involved 300 officers, including 100 members of the SEK.[865][866][867] 158 persons were arrested. Among the detainees were 19 Category C-supporters and 22 Category B-supporters.[439][866] Supporters filed numerous complaints against the police for use of excessive violence.[868] 39 people at the discotheque were injured.[440] Also bystanders were affected.[440] Police initially claimed they had been pelted with bottles and furnishings, but later corrected their statement and admitted that there had been no resistance.[865][440][439] The police had allegedly beaten defenseless people.[869] Police stated that the raid was a preventative measure on short notice to prevent hooligans from organizing for the upcoming match against Union Berlin on 21 August 2005.[440][866] There were speculations that police also took revenge for riots during the match between BFC Dynamo and SV Yeşilyurt at the opening of the season.[440][439] More than 1,000 police officers were deployed to the derby and the match was played without crowd trouble.[866][867] Banners in solidarity with the supporters of BFC Dynamo were displayed in 17 football stadiums across Germany during the following matchdays.[870]\\n\\nThe return match between BFC Dynamo and Union Berlin in the 2005–06 NOFV-Oberliga Nord was played at the Stadion im Sportforum on 13 May 2006. The standing was 1–1 when supporters of BFC Dynamo invaded the pitch in an attempt to storm the block of Union Berlin around the 75th minute.[871] Supporters of Union Berlin fled in panic.[872] The match was abandoned and Union Berlin was awarded a 2–0 win.[871][873] The players of BFC Dynamo wore the motto \\\"No power of violence\\\" on their shirts in the following match against BFC Preussen away on 17 May 2006.[874] The Stadion im Sportforum was temporarily closed for matches in the NOFV-Oberliga Nord after the riots.[457] The riots during the match against 1. FC Union Berlin threw the club into a financial crisis. Treasurer Sven Radicke concluded: \\\"Four years of our work were ruined in five minutes\\\".[459]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo has often attracted hooligans from outside, and hooligans who are otherwise not involved in the supporter scene, to high-profile matches.[520][875][530] The club has repeatedly complained about so-called \\\"riot tourists\\\".[530][876] Riots broke out after the match against Berliner AK 07 in the final of the 2009–10 Berlin Cup at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark on 2 June 2010. Around 100–150 supporters of BFC Dynamo attempted to invade the pitch after the final whistle.[519][875] Match stewards and players of BFC Dynamo threw themselves in to restrain supporters and prevent further riots.[519][877][875][520] One of them was goalkeeper Nico Thomaschewski, who later received an award from the Berlin Football Association (BFV) for his actions.[875] Polish fans of Pogoń Szczecin were allegedly linked to the riots.[875] Those who had invaded the pitch were whistled by other supporters of BFC Dynamo when they returned to the stands.[878]\\n\\nMajor riots then occurred after the match against 1. FC Kaiserslautern in the first round of the 2011-12 DFB-Pokal at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark on 3 July 2011.[528][529] Around 200–300 supporters of BFC Dynamo invaded the buffer zone and stormed the guest block after the match.[530][520] 18 police officers and many supporters from Kaiserslautern were injured in the attack.[520] The Chairman of the Economic Council Peter Meyer openly expressed his embarrassment and disappointment over the behavior of some supporters and publicly apologized.[530] There were allegations that hooligans outside the BFC Dynamo environment had been involved.[530] While the police stated that most of those arrested were from Berlin, the club claimed it had never seen most of the recent perpetrators before.[520]\\n\\nThe contemporary supporter scene\\nThe contemporary supporter scene contains various subcultures and categories of supporters. It ranges from older supporters to younger ultras.[749] Older supporters constitute an essential part of the supporter scene.[752] Many are active in the supporter group 79er.[875] The group is credited for its commitment to the club, notably the youth teams. Its members have been supporters of BFC Dynamo since the late 1970s.[875][717]\\n\\nThe supporter scene played an important part in saving the club from bankruptcy in 2001.[637] Supporters organized a demonstration against the impending bankruptcy. The demonstration marched from the Sportforum to the Rotes Rathaus where it was met by the former club president and SPD politician Karin Halsch.[368][369] Supporters threw parties and organized collections, made donations and travelled to countries such as Austria and Switzerland to convince creditors to accept smaller pay-offs in order to save the cub.[637] Supporters also installed bucket seats at the Stadion im Sportforum and built a new clubhouse in the Sportforum during the insolvency.[729][879] The insolvency crisis remains a defining moment for older supporters.[637] The supporter scene has traditionally arranged an annual Mike-Polley-Gedenkturnier, which is a football fan tournament in memory of Mike Polley.[822][880] The first edition of the fan tournament was arranged in the Sportforum Hohenschönhausen in 2003 and comprised 28 teams.[881] A march in memory of Mike Polley in Leipzig in 2018 was attended by 850 supporters of BFC Dynamo.[882]\\n\\nNew groups of younger ultra-oriented supporters have emerged since the 2000s.[875][717] Supporter group Fraktion H was founded in 2006 by younger supporters who wanted to create more atmosphere in the stadium.[875][717] A minor ultras scene then emerged with the founding of supporter group Ultras BFC in 2011. The ultras of BFC Dynamo have initiated campaigns such as \\\"Brown is not Claret\\\" and have also engaged in football tournaments for refugees.[845][717][883][608] The club has encouraged the new groups of younger supporters and club management has taken a stand against racism and right-wing extremism.[884][883][608] Fraktion H maintains a friendship with the supporters of Eintracht Trier, while members of the now dissolved Ultras BFC have had contacts with the ultras of Swedish football club GAIS.[885]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo is affiliated with Fanprojekt Berlin, which is an independent organization that engages in socio-pedagogical fan work.[752][886] The organization supports young fans in various aspects of life and aims at promoting a positive supporter culture.[886] BFC Dynamo engages in active fan work and has taken measures to control violent elements, to exclude known violators and to distance itself from radical supporters.[752][530][883] Far-right symbols and slogans are not tolerated by the club.[752] The Chairman of the Economic Council, Peter Meyer, stated publicly in connection with a friendly match against Hertha BSC in 2007 that the club did not want people who cannot follow the rules and that \\\"anyone who shouts Nazi slogans will be thrown out of the stadium\\\".[495] Lawyer and former Vice President of BFC Dynamo René Lau said in an interview with Deutsche Welle in 2019: \\\"If you had asked me 25 years ago [if BFC had a problem with Nazis], I would have said yes. But is today\'s BFC Dynamo a Nazi club? I would vehemently dispute that.\\\"[637] A large number of stadium bans has been issued by the club since the mid-2000s.[887][530] A total of 40 stadium bans was issued only in 2006.[888][887] No riots has occurred since 2011.[752]\\n\\nThe contemporary supporter scene has includes groups such as 79er, Mythos BFC, Fraktion H, Piefkes, Ultras BFC, East Company, Riot Sport, Black Boys Dynamo, Bärenbande, Gegengerade, Hipstercrew, Märkische Jungs, Sektion Süddeutschland and Banda Invicta.[875][889][717][890] Supporter group Gegengerade is a left wing-oriented fan club.[890] A number of supporters BFC Dynamo had been members of the \\\"Anti-Fascist Football Fan Initiative\\\" (AFFI) aleady back in 1993.[891][892] Supporters of BFC Dynamo have occasionally displayed a Norwegian flag with the text \\\"Thanks Norway\\\", in memory of Norway\'s 2–0 win over Nazi Germany in the quarter-finals of the 1936 Summer Olympics. Another banner that has occasionally been displayed at the stadium contains the text \\\"There Is A Light That Never Goes Out\\\", with reference to the 1980s British cult band The Smiths.[893]\\n\\nUltras BFC announced its dissolution on 23 January 2023, after the group had lost essential material in an attack. An individual in the group was attacked by a group of people in front of his private residence and robbed of essential group material. The group apologized to the supporter scene of BFC Dynamo and consequently dissolved, but at the same time announced that this was not the end.[894] The attack has been traced to Cottbus.[895] A new supporter group named Banda Invicta eventually presented itself with a banner and a coreography on the first matchday of the 2023-24 Regionalliga Nordost on 29 July 2023. The coreography read \\\"On to a new chapter\\\".[896]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo had 100 Category C and 190 Category-B supporters in 2019.[897] Younger hooligans of BFC Dynamo have contacts with supporter group Kaliber 030 at Hertha.[637][898] 20–25 supporters of BFC Dynamo joined Hertha in the guest block of the Stadion an der Alten Försterei during the derby between Union Berlin and Hertha on 2 November 2019.[899] Older hooligans of BFC Dynamo, on the other hand, maintain friendly relationships with like-minded supporters of 1. FC Magdeburg.[637] Supporters of BFC Dynamo wanted to travel in numbers to the return leg against VfB Oldenburg in the promotion play-offs for the 3. Liga on 4 June 2022. Up to 2,500 supporters of BFC Dynamo wanted to join the team in Oldenburg.[900] Around 1,300 supporters of BFC Dynamo was eventually admitted to the Marschweg-Stadion, where they marked their presence with a banner, a scarf choreography and flares.[901][902][903]\\n\\nOne of the most well-known books in Germany about the supporter scene of BFC Dynamo is \\\"Der BFC war schuld am Mauerbau\\\" by German author Andreas Gläser (de). The book was first published in 2002 and describes the supporter scene from the late 1970s and forward. The club, its reputation and supporter scene, was also the theme of stage play \\\"Dynamoland\\\" by Gudrun Herrbold. The play was set up in 2007 and involved young football players from BFC Dynamo as well as Andreas Gläser.[784][520][904] The fanzine \\\"Zugriff\\\" is dedicated to BFC Dynamo. The fanzine has been produced by Andreas Gläser and members of supporter group Gegengerade since 2008.[905] The tenth and latest issue was published in 2014. The tenth issue came with as music CD mixed by Andreas Gläser. The CD included numerous ska and punk tracks as well as a 25 seconds long recording of Erich Mielke ranting about skinheads and punks.[749]\\n\\nMusicians from German rock band Klaus Renft Combo composed the anthem \\\"Auf, Dynamo!\\\" for BFC Dynamo in 1999.[906] German rap musician Joe Rilla has also dedicated a song to BFC Dynamo. The song is called \\\"Heb die Faust Hoch (BFC Dynamo Straßenhymne)\\\" and was released in 2008. Joe Rilla, whose real name is Hagen Stoll (de), has a background in the hooligan scene of BFC Dynamo.[907] The clothing store Hoolywood on Schönhauser Allee in Prenzlauer Berg is associated with the supporter scene of BFC Dynamo. The store was founded at the beginning of the 1990s.[752][904][908] The store has been an advertising partner of BFC Dynamo.[909]\\n\\nRivalries\\nSG Dynamo Dresden\\nThe oldest rival of BFC Dynamo is SG Dynamo Dresden. The rivalry dates back to 1954 when the team of Dynamo Dresden and its place in the DDR-Oberliga was transferred to SC Dynamo Berlin during the course of the 1954-55 season. The relocation aroused a sense of victimhood among the fans of Dynamo Dresden which would later be compounded by the successes of BFC Dynamo.[758] Matters were exacerbated when additional players of Dynamo Dresden were delegated to Dynamo Berlin by the German Football Association of the GDR (DFV) following the relegation of Dynamo Dresden after the 1962–63 season.[910] The antagonism between the two clubs was underpinned by a historical German rivalry between Prussian Berlin and Saxony.[719][911] It was fueled by contemporary resentment in Dresden at the better provision of housing and consumer goods in the East German capital.[719] East Berliners were generally unpopular outside the city limits, especially in the southern regional districts of East Germany. They were considered arrogant and clearly preferred.[751]\\n\\nDynamo Dresden slowly recovered from the relocation. The club was declared a regional district center of excellence (German: Leistungszentrum) by the regional district board of the DTSB on 5 August 1968.[912][913] The club could now draw on the best players in Bezirk Dresden.[912] Dynamo Dresden eventually re-established itself in the DDR-Oberliga and became campions once again in the 1970-71 DDR-Oberliga. BFC Dynamo and Dynamo Dresden then met in the final of the 1970-71 FDGB-Pokal. Klaus Sammer scored 1-0 for Dynamo Dresden, but Norbert Johannsen equalized on a penalty. Dynamo Dresden eventually won the match 2-1 after a second goal by Sammer in extra time.[57] Dynamo Dresden thus secured the first Double in the history of East German football.[914] However, BFC Dynamo did not go completely empty-handed from the final. The team qualified for its first UEFA competition as runners-up. Its participation in the 1971–72 European Cup Winners\' Cup would be a success.\\n\\n\\nA duel between Harald Schütze (left) and Reinhard Häfner of Dynamo Dresden (right) during a match between BFC Dynamo and Dynamo Dresden in the DDR-Oberliga in 1976.\\nBFC Dynamo met Dynamo Dresden away on the sixth matchday of the 1974-75 DDR-Oberliga on 21 September 1974. The standing was 2–2 at the end of the match, after an equalizer from Norbert Johannsen on a penalty. Shortly before the final whistle, referee Robert Pischke from Rostock awarded Dynamo Dresden a controversial penalty. Siegmar Wätzlich converted the penalty and Dynamo Dresden won the match 3–2.[915][916] The East German football weekly Die neue Fußballwoche (FuWo) commented: \\\"Shortly before the end, the same thing on the other side, but this one surprised even the objective Dresdeners about it. They hadn\'t seen any opposing influence on the falling Richter... The Berliners exploded in outrage at the penalty kick, which snatched a point from them in the last minute.\\\"[916] Dynamo Dresden finished the season in third place, two points ahead of BFC Dynamo. BFC Dynamo finished the season in fourth place, but with a better goal difference. Dynamo Dresden had thus captured the place in the 1975-76 UEFA Cup narrowly ahead of BFC Dynamo. Referee Pischke was not selected for any more DDR-Oberliga matches and eventually chose to end his refereeing career.[917] He would years later become the president of F.C. Hansa Rostock.[918]\\n\\nDynamo Dresden would come to dominate East German football in the 1970s. The team managed to capture a third consecutive league title in the 1977–78 DDR-Oberliga. What happened after is subject to various rumors. Formal title celebrations took place in June 1978 at the hotel and restaurant Bastein at Prager Straße in Dresden. Erich Mielke paid a visit as the president of SV Dynamo to congratulate the team to the title. Dynamo Dresden player Reinhard Häfner recalls how Mielke held a speech where he said that he would be happier if BFC Dynamo was champions. Mielke should have added that \\\"since BFC Dynamo is also SV Dynamo, the title stays in the family, so to speak, and that is good too\\\". According to other versions of the same event, he allegedly proclaimed that everything will be done so that in the coming year, the champion will come from Berlin, and that it was now the turn of the BFC Dynamo.[919][920][921][922][nb 15]\\n\\n\\nThomas Doll and defending Matthias Döschner of Dynamo Dresden during a match between Dynamo Dresden and BFC Dynamo in 1987.\\nBFC Dynamo stood out among other clubs within SV Dynamo. The club was located at the frontline of the Cold War. It was also a representative of the capital of East Germany. This meant that the club had to be well equipped.[67] BFC Dynamo would come to benefit from a nationwide scouting system, supported by 33 training centers (TZ) of SV Dynamo across East Germany.[68][927] No less than 40 full-time trainers worked for the club.[928] The team embarked on a period of unparalleled success in the 1978–79 season under young coach Jürgen Bogs. Dynamo Dresden had been the dominant team in East German football until then. BFC Dynamo would now be its main obstacle to success.[nb 16]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo opened the 1978-79 DDR-Oberliga with ten consecutive wins. The team thus broke the previous record of Dynamo Dresden of seven consecutive wins from the 1972-73 DDR-Oberliga. Dynamo Dresden, on the other hand, had a moderately successful start to the season and stood in second place. The two teams met in the 11th matchday in front of 33,000 spectators at Dynamo-Stadion in Dresden on 2 December 1978.[934] The match ended in a draw 1-1 after an equalizer by Hans-Jürgen Riediger for BFC Dynamo. The match was marked by crowd trouble, with 38 fans to both teams arrested.[4] 17 of the 38 fans arrested were fans of BFC Dynamo.[935] Inexperienced linesman Günter Supp should allegedly have missed an offside position on Riediger in the situation leading up to the equalizer.[936][937] There were accusations in Dresden that the match had been manipulated by the referees in favor of BFC Dynamo.[4][180][201] This alleged manipulation was cited as yet another example of discrimination against the Saxon city in comparison with East Berlin.[4][180] BFC Dynamo continued to lead the league for the rest of the season. The team finally secured its first DDR-Oberliga title after defeating Dynamo Dresden 3–1 in the 24th match day in front of 22,000 spectators at Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark on 6 June 1979.[938]\\n\\nThe 1979-80 DDR-Oberliga would be tight race between the two rivals. Dynamo Dresden led the league for most of the season. Dynamo Dresden was still in first place before the last matchday. However, BFC Dynamo was only one point behind. The two rivals met at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark in the last matchday of the league season on 10 May 1980. Dynamo Dresden only needed a draw to win the league title. There was huge excitement around the match and the stadium was sold out. Die neue Fußballwoche (FuWo) reported on \\\"international match atmosphere\\\".[939] The standing was 0-0 for a long time. Dynamo Dresden player Peter Kotte fell in the BFC Dynamo penalty area with about 15 minutes left of regular time, but Dynamo Dresden was denied a penalty.[940] Norbert Trieloff instead scored a goal for BFC Dynamo just a moment later. BFC Dynamo eventually won the match 1-0 and captured its second consecutive league title in front of 30,000 spectators. Dynamo Dresden would not come this close to BFC Dynamo in the league until the end of the 1980s. It was rumoured that referee Hans Kulicke from Oderberg had favored BFC Dynamo. However, also BFC Dynamo had been denied a chance to decide the match. A goal by Hartmut Pelka had been disallowed by referee Kulicke due to a foul on Dynamo Dresden goalkeeper Bernd Jakubowski.[921]\\n\\nBoth clubs were affiliated to SV Dynamo and supported by the security organs. However, BFC Dynamo was more associated with the Stasi, while Dynamo Dresden was more associated with the Volkspolizei.[941] BFC Dynamo was known as the favourite club of the head of the Stasi Erich Mielke.[942] Dynamo Dresden, on the other hand, was patronaged by Volkspolizei Lieutenant general Willi Nyffenegger. Nyffenegger was the long-time head of the regional district authority of the Volkspolizei in Bezirk Dresden.[943] However, also Dynamo Dresden had supporters in the Stasi. The Stasi had helped Dynamo Dresden to obtain secret information about the line-up of FC Bayern Munich before the match between Dynamo Dresden and FC Bayern Munich in the 1973–74 European Cup on 7 November 1973.[944] Dynamo Dresden would also be supported by Stasi Major general Horst Böhm in the 1980s.[945] Böhm was the head of the regional district administration of the Stasi in Bezirk Dresden.[946][947][758] He was a committed local patriot when it came to Dynamo Dresden and a sponsoring member of the club.[948][947][949] The antagonism between the two clubs also spread to the Stasi Guards Regiment \\\"Felix E. Dzerzhinsky\\\".[719][4] The behavior of members of a Dresden unit during a match between the two teams in 1985 was likened to that of \\\"rioting fans\\\" by another Stasi officer.[719] Some Stasi guards had hurled abuse at BFC Dynamo players, shouting \\\"Bent champions!\\\" as they left the pitch.[758]\\n\\nResentment in Dresden over the rise of BFC Dynamo was worsened when three top players of Dynamo Dresden, Gerd Weber, Peter Kotte and Matthias Müller, were arrested on suspicion of planning to defect to West Germany in 1981.[950][4] Weber had solicited plans to defect, but the other two had not.[951] Weber received a prison sentence and a lifetime ban from playing football at any level in East Germany, while Kotte and Müller received lifetime bans from playing in the top two tiers for alleged complicity.[950][4][952] Neither would return to the Oberliga. The punishment against the three players led to rumors and protests in Dresden.[950] They also fueled local patriotism and anti-Berlin sentiments in Dresden.[950]\\n\\nFans of Dynamo Dresden saw the lifetime bans on Weber, Kotte and Müller as \\\"an order from Erich Mielke\\\" designed to weaken Dynamo Dresden.[950] Also, Kotte and Klaus Sammer has claimed they were part of a delibate plan by Mielke to weaken Dynamo Dresden.[953][954] However, such claims are doubtful.[953] The three players had been reported by an unofficial collaborator (IM) and Mielke was convinced that all three were originally prepared to defect.[951][953] Kotte was not an isolated case. The great fear of footballers, fans and officials who had fled East Germany was omnipresent at the Stasi.[955] Kotte and Müller knew about the intentions of Weber.[950] Their failure to inform authorities was critical.[950] Former SED First Secretary in Bezik Dresden Hans Modrow concludes that the measures against the three were \\\"generally cautious\\\", given the completely different consequences for other East German citizens in similar contexts. After all, the three were also members of the armed organs (German: Bewaffnete Organe der DDR) with ranks.[956] Müller said in an interview with Dresdner Neueste Nachrichten in 2011 that he \\\"knew one hundred percent\\\" that the uncompromising actions against the three players were a deliberate attempt by the Stasi to weaken Dynamo Dresden in order to secure the supremacy of BFC Dynamo.[957]\\n\\n\\nBFC Dynamo midfielder Bernd Schulz celebrates a goal against Dynamo Dresden in the DFV-Supercup together with Thomas Doll (left) and Jörg Fügner (right) in 1989.\\nBFC Dynamo and Dynamo Dresden would be the two main contenders for titles in East German football during the 1980s. BFC Dynamo dominated the DDR-Oberliga and won consecutive titles, while Dynamo Dresden had major success in the FDGB-Pokal. The two teams met in the 1981-82 FDGB-Pokal and 1983-84 FDGB-Pokal final. Dynamo Dresden won both finals and thus stopped BFC Dynamo from completing the Double.[940] The teams then also met in the 1984-85 FDGB-Pokal final. The performance of the referees in the final was controversial. A review by the DFV found that 30 percent of the referee decisions during the match had been wrong, and that 80 percent of those had been of disadvantage to Dynamo Dresden.[958] Referee Manfred Roßner was banned one year from officiating matches above second tier after the final.[959][960][958] However, nothing emerged that indicated that Roßner had been bought by the Stasi.[961] Dynamo Dresden won the final 3–2 in front of 48,000 spectators at the Stadion der Weltjugend. It was the fourth loss for BFC Dynamo against Dynamo Dresden in the final of the FDGB-Pokal and the third time that Dynamo Dresden had stopped the team from completing the Double.[940] However, BFC Dynamo would eventually succeed in completing the Double in the 1987–88 season, defeating FC Carl Zeiss Jena 2–0 in final of the 1987–88 FDGB-Pokal.\\n\\nDisturbances by spectators was a regular occurrence at matches between the two teams.[758] BFC Dynamo was met by immense hostility during away matches in Dresden. Fans of BFC Dynamo would respond to the hatred they met by singing chants in praise of Erich Mielke as a provocation.[758][178] They also made fun of the food shortage in Dresden.[753] Fans of BFC Dynamo are known to have brought coveted tropical fruits, that were only available in East Berlin, to away matches in Saxony. The fruits were then thrown at the home crowd.[178][753][751][nb 17] In Dresden they threw green bananas at the home fans and shouted: \\\"We brought you something - Bananas, bananas!\\\".[753] East German state television would always try to hide riots from viewers and sound engineers also had to drown out chants that were considered negative, such as \\\"Stasi out\\\". The match between BFC Dynamo and SG Dynamo Dresden was the most explosive encounter. At one point, the match between BFC Dynamo and SG Dynamo Dresden was even ordered to be recorded completely without sound.[776] A group of about 250 hooligans of Dynamo Dresden chanted anti-Semitic slogans against BFC Dynamo, such as \\\"Berlin Jews!\\\" and \\\"Jews\' sow!, during the match between the two teams in the 1987-88 DDR-Oberliga in East Berlin on 6 April 1988.[792][963] A number of supporters of SG Dynamo Dresden were then allegedly arrested after the match.[963]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo\'s ten-year dominance in the league was eventually broken by Dynamo Dresden in the 1988–89 season. BFC Dynamo won a second consecutive cup title in the 1988-89 FDGB-Pokal, but Dynamo Dresden became the new champion in the 1988-89 DDR-Oberliga. BFC Dynamo and Dynamo Dresden then met in the first ever DFV-Supercup in 1989. BFC Dynamo won the match 4–1 in front of 22,347 spectators at the Stadion der Freundschaft in Cottbus and became the first and only winner of the DFV-Supercup in the history of East German football.\\n\\nBFC Dynamo and Dynamo Dresden met 60 times in the Oberliga, FDGB-Pokal and DFV-Supercup between 1966 and 1991. BFC Dynamo won 21 matches and Dynamo Dresden won 27 matches. BFC Dynamo and Dynamo Dresden also met 10 times in the Regionalliga Nordost between 1995 and 2000. BFC Dynamo won 3 matches and Dynamo Dresden won 5 matches. The last meeting ended 1–1 and took place in the 1999-00 Regionalliga Nordost on 26 April 2000. The two teams rarely meet these days, because Dynamo Dresden regularly appears in the second or third tier of the German football league system. Former Dynamo Dresden player Ralf Minge expressed in an interview in 2018 his satisfaction that Dynamo Dresden has advanced past BFC Dynamo, but also said that he would not mind new duels with BFC Dynamo and that duels with BFC Dynamo \\\"have a certain charm\\\".[964]\\n\\n1. FC Union Berlin\\nFurther information: Berlin derby\\nBFC Dynamo and 1. FC Union Berlin were founded only a few days apart. Both clubs were formed during the reorganization of East German football in December 1965 and January 1966, when the football departments of ten sports clubs (SC) were reorganized into dedicated football clubs.[965] However, Union Berlin was not part of the original plan. Two football clubs had already been planned for East Berlin. They were to be formed from the football departments of SC Dynamo Berlin and ASK Vorwärts Berlin.[64] In addition, TSC Berlin played only in the second tier DDR-Liga at the time.[965][64] The founding of Union Berlin probably owed much to the intervention of the powerful Herbert Warnke.[965][762][966] Herbert Warnke was the chairman of the national state trade union FDGB and a member of the SED Politburo.[965] Dynamo Berlin and Vorwärts Berlin were both associated with the armed and security organs.[965][64] Herbert Warnke therefore argued for the formation of a civilian club for the working people of East Berlin.[965][64] He would be a passionate fan of Union Berlin.[967] Another high-ranking SED politician who pushed for the founding a civilian football club in East Berlin was the SED First Secretary in East Berlin and SED Politburo member Paul Verner.[968] Verner held a speech at the founding ceremony of Union Berlin.[969]\\n\\nBoth BFC Dynamo and Union Berlin belonged to the elite in East German football.[762][970] The new football clubs were intended as centers of excellence, with the right to draw on talents within designated geographical areas.[4][64] BFC Dynamo was supported by the Stasi, while Union Berlin was supported by the FDGB.[971][972][nb 18] However, Union Berlin was able to trace its origins back to FC Olympia Oberschöneweide in 1906.[753] BFC Dynamo had no history before East Germany. The supporters of Union Berlin therefore considered their club to be a genuine football club, unlike BFC Dynamo.[762] However, even as a civilian club, Union Berlin was also part of the sports political system.[177][975][65] The founding of the Union Berlin was organized by the then SED First Secretary in Köpenick Hans Modrow.[976] Like Herbert Warnke, Hans Modrow would be a sponsoring member of the club.[971][976] The most important positions on the board of Union Berlin were exclusively held by directors of state-owned factories or SED representatives.[65] Union Berlin was state-funded and all decisions in club had to be reported to the all-powerful central sports agency DTSB.[975] The DTSB stood in turn under direct control of the SED Central Committee.[977]\\n\\nThe rivalry between BFC Dynamo and Union Berlin began in the mid-1960s. It was initially based on the geographical proximity to each other.[66] BFC Dynamo and Union Berlin were two clubs from East Berlin in the DDR-Oberliga.[66] BFC Dynamo struggled in the 1966-67 DDR-Oberliga and was threatened with relegation. The feud between the two clubs began when fans of Union Berlin mocked BFC Dynamo with a banner saying \\\"We greet the relegated\\\" during a league match at the Stadion an der Alten Försterei on 26 April 1967.[45][972] Union Berlin won the match by 3–0 and BFC Dynamo was eventually relegated to the DDR-Liga at the end of the season.[45] While BFC Dynamo was playing in the second tier DDR-Liga, Union Berlin surprisingly won the 1967–68 FDGB-Pokal.[762] However, BFC Dynamo immediately bounced back and managed to establish itself in the DDR-Oberliga. Union Berlin would then itself be relegated to the DDR-Liga after the 1968-69 DDR-Oberliga, but also managed to return to the DDR-Oberliga after just one season in the second tier. Union Berlin would be the stronger of the two teams until the 1970s.[978]\\n\\nThe rivalry between the two clubs intensified in the early 1970s.[66] The player of Union Berlin, Klaus Korn, was suspended after a heated derby in the 1970–71 DDR-Oberliga at the Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum on 28 October 1970.[66][45] The performance of the referees had been \\\"catastrophic\\\" according to private notes from the then Second Club Secretary and Vice President of Union Berlin Günter Mielis, and the match ended with riots.[66][979][980] Klaus Korn had insulted players in BFC Dynamo with slurs such as \\\"Stasi-pig\\\". The DFV Legal Commission imposed a one-year ban on Klaus Korn after a circumstantial trial.[981][982] The DFV Legal Commission also demanded that Union Berlin considered his exclusion from the club. Klaus Korn was then excluded from the club and would never play in the DDR-Oberliga again.[981][982][66][45] Unrest broke out again at a derby in Hohenschönhausen one year later. Eight spectators were arrested after the match between BFC Dynamo and Union Berlin in the 1971–72 DDR-Oberliga at the Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum on 28 December 1971.[983] The match was attended by 14,000 spectators and the stadium was sold out.[984][712]\\n\\nThe football landscape in East Berlin changed before the 1971–72 season. Vorwärts Berlin was relocated to Frankfurt an der Oder on 31 July 1971. BFC Dynamo and Union Berlin were from now on the only major football clubs in East Berlin.[985] The relocation meant that BFC Dynamo could now take over the role of the dominant team for the armed organs in East Berlin. The team would also have opportunity to eventually move into the larger and more centrally located Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark, which led to increased interest in the club and growing attendance numbers.[66] The districts in East Berlin had previously been divided between BFC Dynamo, Vorwärts Berlin and Union Berlin. Each club was able to recruit young players from training centers (TZ) in their districts.[64][65] All training centers that had previously belonged to Vorwärts Berlin were now given to BFC Dynamo.[64][65] The DTSB allegedly saw more potential in BFC Dynamo.[64] BFC Dynamo now had access to two thirds of all training centers (TZ) in East Berlin.[65][35] This meant that BFC Dynamo had gained a much stronger position in East Berlin than Union Berlin when it came to recruiting young players.[978] FC Vorwärts Frankfurt was given Bezirk Potsdam as a catchment area, in addition to Bezirk Frankfurt. Bezirk Potsdam had previously been assigned to Union Berlin and thus had to be handed over to Vorwärts Frankfurt. This further weakened Union Berlin in relation to BFC Dynamo.[986][65][nb 19]\\n\\nUnion Berlin was relegated to the DDR-Liga after the 1972–73 season. The Union Berlin star and national team player Reinhard Lauck was transferred to BFC Dynamo after the relegation.[987] The loss of Lauck was a hard blow for the team. Lauck had contributed greatly to the victory in the final of the 1967–68 FDGB-Pokal and was well-liked among the supporters of Union Berlin.[987] Supporters of Union Berlin are said to have gathered outside his apartment, to appeal to him to stay in the team and play in the second tier.[988][989] But Lauck had already decided to change team.[988][990] The DFV had allegedly advised him to switch to BFC Dynamo in order to continue playing in the national team.[987] According to a regulation in the 1970 DFV Football Resolution (German: DFV-Fußballbeschluss), national team players in clubs that had been relegated from the DDR-Oberliga should switch clubs in order to remain competitive.[991] Lauck would make a successful appearance for East Germany in the 1974 FIFA World Cup and would win gold with East Germany in the 1976 Summer Olympics.[987][989] Lauck became the team captain of BFC Dynamo in the 1974–75 season.[82] He would later win two league titles with BFC Dynamo before ending his career due to a knee injury.[989][992]\\n\\nUnion Berlin would remain in the DDR-Liga for several seasons. Instead of playing matches against BFC Dynamo in the DDR-Oberliga, the team was now left to compete with the reserve team of BFC Dynamo, the BFC Dynamo II. Union Berlin would also suffer more blows which further weakened its position in relation to BFC Dynamo. Herbert Warnke passed in 1975 and was replaced as chairman of the FDGB by Harry Tisch.[971] Harry Tisch had begun his political career in Rostock and chose instead to give the support of the FDGB to F.C. Hansa Rostock.[971] Union Berlin thus lost the support of the FDGB and also no longer had any support in the top of the political hierarchy.[993] From no on, the club could only rely on support from the district administration of the SED in East Berlin and local state-owned enterprises, such as VEB Kabelwerk Oberspree (KWO) and VEB Transformatorenwerk Oberschöneweide (TRO).[994][971]\\n\\nThe DTSB and the DFV had also continued their efforts to concentrate resources on a few clubs during the 1970s.[995] A number of football clubs became specially promoted focus clubs in the 1970 DFV Football Resolution.[60][996] The focus clubs were meant to be strengthened through player transfers. Players in teams that had been relegated from the DDR-Oberliga should also switch to focus clubs.[997] The focus clubs were also equipped with more staff as well as better material and technical conditions.[998][60][996] BFC Dynamo became the focus club in East Berlin.[999][1000][995][nb 20] Even more advantages were then given to the focus clubs in the 1976 DFV Football Resolution. The focus clubs would now be allowed to delegate youth players from other football clubs. They would also be provided with more youth coaches from the DFV and have the right to accommodate twice as many students in their affiliated Children and Youth Sports Schools (KJS) every year, compared to other football clubs.[1001][999][1002] Union Berlin would now have to delegate some of its best young players to BFC Dynamo.[978][nb 21] One example was the talented Detlef Helms, who was delegated to BFC Dynamo as a 17-year-old in 1977.[65][970]\\n\\nUnion Berlin returned to the Oberliga in the 1976–77 season. Stadion an der Alten Försterei was a small football stadium without cinder tracks where the crowd stood close to the pitch.[762][990] Union Berlin had become the focus of hooligan attention.[719] Matches at the Stadion an der Alten Föresterei had regularly been interrupted by spectators throwing objects on the pitch.[1003] The derby between BFC Dynamo and Union Berlin was now such as heated affair that the matches were moved by the DFV to the neutral Stadion der Weltjugend in Mitte.[1004] It was considered that safety could not be guaranteed with the larger number of spectators.[1005][1006][719][762] The Stadion an der Alten Försterei was known for its atmosphere and the Stadion der Weltjugend was located only a few minutes away from the home district of BFC Dynamo.[990][66] The move was therefore seen as a major disadvantage by the fans to Union Berlin and further diluted their aversion to BFC Dynamo.[45][66][nb 22] Union Berlin defeated BFC Dynamo 1–0 in front of 45,000 spectators at the Stadion der Weltjugend in the first meeting of the 1976–77 season on 4 September 1976.[1008][294][95] Union Berlin also won the return match on 19 February 1977.[95] The two wins against BFC Dynamo during the 1976–77 season cemented the reputation of Union Berlin as a cult club and crowd puller.[1009]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo established itself as one of the top teams in the DDR-Oberliga from the mid-1970s. Union Berlin would come to play second fiddle in East Berlin from now on and never finish higher than seventh place in the DDR-Oberliga.[1010] In the shadow of BFC Dynamo, Union Berlin would no longer have any major sporting significance in East Germany.[1011] Union Berlin became a yo-yo team that hovered between the Oberliga and the DDR-Liga.[1010] Supporters of Union Berlin saw BFC Dynamo as the highest representative of the security organs and the police, with privileges in player recruitment and financial support as well as the political clout of Mielke.[762] This was supposedly in contrast to their own club, which they regarded as an underdog rooted in the working class.[762][719][1012][753] BFC Dynamo would be disliked all over East Germany for its successes and its connection to the Stasi.[910][137][38] This was also reflected in the derby between BFC Dynamo and Union Berlin.[137] The supporters of Union Berlin were seen as oppositional.[137] This is illustrated in the famous sentence of the editor-in-chief of the satirical magazine Eulenspiegel: \\\"Not all Union fans are enemies of the state, but all enemies of the state are Union fans.\\\"[137][1013] But the fact that people supported Union Berlin did not automatically mean that they were against the state.[177] Union Berlin got a lot of sympathy as the weaker club.[177][1014] There was a simple rule in East German football, where the least privileged club got the most sympathy.[178] Supporters of Union Berlin cultivated the image of their club as the eternal underdog.[762][1015]\\n\\nClashes between the supporters of the two teams became increasingly common in the 1970s. Union Berlin had one of the most notorious followings in East Germany at this time.[32] The supporters of Union Berlin often went to away matches in large numbers.[32] Fights were initially won by the supporters of Union Berlin. They were in the clear majority and could chase the supporters of BFC Dynamo from the streets.[972] A punch in the face and a stolen scarf was an experience for many young supporters of BFC Dynamo at this time.[990] But BFC Dynamo gained more and more young supporters with its growing successes in the late 1970s.[174] Many came from working-class families in Prenzlauer Berg.[749] The supporters of BFC Dynamo would eventually begin to appear extremely well organized and by the early 1980s they began to fight back.[972][32] The tide now turned and the supporters of BFC Dynamo would win all fights between the supporters of the two teams from now on.[972][990] Derbies at the Stadion der Weltjugend usually ended with a couple of hundred supporters of BFC Dynamo chasing the supporters of Union Berlin along Chausseestraße down towards the Friedrichsstrasse S-Bahn station.[1016][32][1017] The fights often continued on the side streets of Friedrichstraße.[1017]\\n\\nUnion Berlin is sometimes portrayed as having been an opponent of the East German system and derbies between BFC Dynamo and Union Berlin during the East German era have been hyped as some kind of domestic political showdown.[1018] But Union Berlin was mostly just a club struggling against unfavorable conditions.[1018] The club had become disadvantaged by the state sports politics compared to local rival BFC Dynamo.[1018] Honorary President of Union Berlin Günter Mielis has said: \\\"Union was not a club of resistance fighters, but we had to fight against a lot of political and economic resistance over and over again. We got strength from our fans\\\".[1019] However, Union Berlin would eventually become known for a supporter scene that was anti-establishment, where dissidents could vent their disdain for the system in the anonymity of a crowd.[1010] Supporters of Union Berlin also saw themselves as stubborn and non-conformist, but this image should not be confused with actual resistance.[38] Provocation was part of football in East Germany and people shouted out anything, because it was possible to get away with it.[1020] A critical attitude to the system was something that football supporters across East Germany had in common in the 1970s and 1980s.[1021]\\n\\nSupporters of Union Berlin from the East German era concede that it is an exaggeration to call the club a \\\"resistance club\\\".[1022][970] A supporter of Union Berlin has said: \\\"With the best of intentions, Union fans did not contribute to the overthrow of the GDR. No way, we were interested in football. There is the cliché about the club for the enemies of the state, but that wasn\'t us\\\".[1023] There were no political groups among the supporters of Union Berlin.[1024] For some supporters of Union Berlin, the dissident reputation of Union Berlin is a legend that was created after Die Wende.[1022] A controversy erupted around Union Berlin in 2011 when it became publicly known that the then President of Union Berlin Dirk Zingler had been a member of the Stasi Guards Regiment \\\"Felix E. Dzerzhinsky\\\" for three years during his military service between 1983 and 1986.[1025][1026] Zingler explained that he had sought to spend his military service in Berlin and claimed that he did not know beforehand that the regiment belonged to the Stasi.[1027] However, the Stasi Guards Regiment \\\"Felix E. Dzerzhinsky\\\" was an elite formation; it was not possible to simply apply for the regiment. The Stasi selected who it thought were best fit to serve with the regiment, only accepting recruits that were \\\"loyal to the line\\\".[1027][1028] Zingler had also been a member of the Socialist Unity Party (SED) and leader in the Free German Youth (FDJ) at the time.[1029][1028] Union Berlin Press spokesman Christian Arbeit commented on the reports about Zingler in 2011 saying: \\\"We do have a very unique history, compared to other clubs. But it wasn\'t us that always claimed we were this big anti-Stasi club. These are stories that get simplified in the media.\\\"[1026]\\n\\nMost supporters of Union Berlin were just normal football supporters.[1020] Politics was not in the foreground.[970] Supporters of Union Berlin from the era have testified that their support for the club had nothing to do with politics.[1030] The club was the most important thing and the identification with Union Berlin had primarily to do with Köpenick.[1030][1031] The rivalry was fueled by local pride from the supporters of the two teams.[1032] However, the political dimension was there nonetheless.[1010] BFC Dynamo was supported by the Stasi, who was disliked by many.[1010] But above all, it was the political instrumentalization of football that irritated supporters of Union Berlin.[1033] The political favoritism of BFC Dynamo greatly contributed to the enthusiasm of the supporters of Union Berlin.[972] Supporters of Union Berlin embraced the image of the underdog fighting the odds.[1004] An expression of the supporters of Union Berlin was: \\\"Better to be a loser than a stupid Stasi pig\\\".[1011]\\n\\nThe derby between BFC Dynamo and Union Berlin was first and foremost a local football derby.[1010] Both clubs had supporters who were not loyal to the line.[1024][1034][751] Also supporters of BFC Dynamo were observed by the Stasi during the 1980s.[1035] East Berlin was divided into two: BFC Dynamo was more strongly represented in some parts, and Union Berlin was more strongly represented in other parts.[972] Which team you supported was very much a question of where you lived.[32] BFC Dynamo was the local team if you grew up in Prenzlauer Berg.[1036] And you lived in Mitte, you were also more likely to be a supporter BFC Dynamo, as the home stadium was only a stone\'s throw away along Schönhauser Allee.[32] But Mitte was also a contested area.[759] The border allegedly ran at Alexanderplatz, where many fights between the supporters of the two teams were fought.[972][760] The home districts of the two clubs, Hohenschönhausen and Köpenick respectively, were always dangerous territory for supporters of the other team.[972]\\n\\n\\nBFC Dynamo midfielder Bernd Schulz (right) celebrating together with team captain Frank Rohde (left) after scoring a goal against 1. FC Union Berlin at the Stadion der Weltjugend on 18 March 1989.\\nBFC Dynamo and Union Berlin met a total of 35 times in the DDR-Oberliga and the FDGB-Pokal. BFC Dynamo won 22 meetings and Union Berlin won 6 meetings. Matches against Union Berlin was often won with big numbers in the late 1970s and 1980s.[45][203] BFC Dynamo defeated Union Berlin with 1–8 and then 7–1 in the round of 16 of the 1978-79 FDGB-Pokal.[45] Hans-Jürgen Riediger scored a hat-trick in both legs.[1037][1038] BFC Dynamo also defeated Union Berlin 8–1 in the Oberliga on 13 September 1986. Thom, Frank Pastor and Christian Backs scored two goals each.[1039] The 1980s was a crushing win for BFC Dynamo. Former BFC Dynamo midfielder Falko Götz concluded that: \\\"Union was no opponent to us\\\".[1016] The two teams met 13 times in the Oberliga and FDGB-Pokal during the 1980s. BFC Dynamo won 11 matches and two matches ended in a draw. The matches between the two local rivals were hard-fought on the pitch.[294] Former BFC Dynamo midfielder Frank Terletzki has said that the victories against Union Berlin were always the best.[203] But despite the rivalry between the clubs, it happened that players hung out outside of football.[1040] Former BFC Dynamo defender Frank Rohde has said that players of BFC Dynamo and Union Berlin often gathered to have a beer together after matches.[294]\\n\\nThere were several transfers between the two clubs. BFC Dynamo recruited some of the best players of Union Berlin, such as Reinard Lauck in 1973, Detlef Helms in 1977 and Waldemar Ksienzyk in 1984.[45][970] But there were also transfers in the other direction. Union Berlin predecessor TSC Oberschöneweide recruited Ralf Quest from SC Dynamo Berlin in 1962. Quest scored the winning goal for Union Berlin in the final of the 1967-68 FDGB-Pokal, when the club won a sensational cup victory.[1041] Union Berlin would then recruit several players from BFC Dynamo over the years, such as Werner Heine in 1966, Werner Voigt, Bernd Kempke and Michael Jakob in 1973, Rainer Rohde in 1976, Rainer Wroblewski in 1977, Olaf Seier in 1983, Ralf Sträßer in 1984, Olaf Hirsch in 1986, Norbert Trieloff in 1987, Mario Maek in 1988, and Marco Kostmann and Thomas Grether in 1989, and Bernd Schulz in 1990.[95][970][294][1042] Union Berlin recruited a couple of players from BFC Dynamo in the 1980s who did some of their best seasons at the club.[1043][990] Olaf Seier became the team captain of Union Berlin and Ralf Sträßer became first and only player in Union Berlin to ever become league top goal scorer during the East German era.[65] Mario Maek saved Union Berlin from relegation with a late 3–2 goal against FC Karl-Marx-Stadt in the last match day of the 1987-88 DDR-Oberliga.[970][1044] As many as three former players of BFC Dynamo were involved in the winning goal for Union Berlin.[1044]\\n\\n\\nSupporters of FC Berlin during a match against 1. FC Union Berlin at the Stadion an der Alten Försterei on 23 September 1990.\\nUnion Berlin played in the DDR-Liga in the 1989–90 season. FC Berlin and Union Berlin met in the second round of the 1990-91 FDGB-Pokal at the Stadion an der Alten Försterei on 23 September 1990. It was the first match between the teams since the fall of the Berlin Wall. BFC Dynamo, now named FC Berlin, had now already lost many of its former top-performers to the West German Bundesliga.[1045][809] Union Berlin was now coached by the former BFC Dynamo player and youth coach Werner Voigt.[1046] Hooligans of FC Berlin stormed the home stands armed with clubs and flares and attacked supporters of Union Berlin at the beginning of the match.[263][809] Union Berlin won the match 2–1 on extra-time.[809] It was the first win for Union Berlin against FC Berlin since 1977.[263] Thomas Grether scored the first goal and Olaf Seier scored the winning goal for Union Berlin in the match. Both players had been brought up in the youth department of BFC Dynamo and had played matches for BFC Dynamo in the DDR-Oberliga.[809] Clashes between supporters of the two teams continued in the city after the match. Serious riots broke out in East Berlin, involving hundreds of supporters.[811]\\n\\nFC Berlin and Union Berlin then met in the promotion round to the 2. Bundesliga in the 1990–91 season. FC Berlin lost the first match 1–0 away in the second round at the Stadion an der Alten Försterei on 8 June 1991. Former BFC Dynamo player Bernd Schulz scored the winning goal for Union Berlin.[1047] FC Berlin then defeated Union Berlin 2–0 in the return match in fifth round in front of 9,475 spectators at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark on 18 June 1991. Heiko Bonan and Thorsten Boer scored one goal each in the match.[1048] FC Berlin was only one point behind leader BSG Stahl Brandenburg before the last round. The team managed to defeat Magdeburg 3–5 away on 23 June 1991. However, BSG Stahl Brandenburg defeated Union Berlin 2–0 away. FC Berlin thus finished in second place and missed promotion. Some supporters of BFC Dynamo are convinced that Union Berlin deliberately lost in order to prevent FC Berlin from advancing to the 2. Bundesliga.[257] FC Berlin and Union Berlin then also met in the promotion round for the 2. Bundesliga in 1991–92 season. FC Berlin won the first match 3–0 at home in the third round on 31 May 1992. The team then also won the return match 0–4 away in the fourth round on 7 June 1992.\\n\\nThe two teams met again in the new Regionalliga Nordost that was formed in 1994–95 season. Werner Voigt became the new coach of FC Berlin during the 1995–96 season. Voigt had a long history with BFC Dynamo but also had history with Union Berlin. Voigt had played for Union Berlin between 1973 and 1975 and had coached the team between 1990 and 1992.[1046] FC Berlin under coach Voigt lost 0–6 to 1. FC Union Berlin in the 1996–97 Regionalliga Nordost at the Stadion im Sportforum on 28 September 1996. It was the biggest defeat so far to Union Berlin.[294] Former FC Berlin player Thorsten Boer scored two goals for Union Berlin in the match.[1049] The two teams met 12 times in total in Regionalliga Nordost between 1994 and 2000. BFC Dynamo won one match and Union Berlin won eight matches. The two teams then met in the round of 16 of the 2000-01 Berlin Cup. The match was played in front of 4,427 spectators at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark on 24 March 2001.[351] Union Berlin won the match 0–3. Riots broke out among supporters of BFC Dynamo in Prenzlauer Berg after the match. The police had to deploy water cannons to control the situation.[855] The most recent meetings between BFC Dynamo and Union Berlin occurred in the 2005–06 NOFV-Oberliga Nord. The first match was played at the Stadion an der Alten Försterei on 21 August 2005. BFC Dynamo was missing striker Danny Kukulies and first-choice goalkeeper Nico Thomaschewski before the match. Kukulies was suspended and Thomaschewski injured.[1050][1051] German police and members of the SEK carried out a controversial raid against supporters of BFC Dynamo the night before the match.[440] Club management initially considered withdrawing from the match. The players voted on whether or not to play the match against Union Berlin.[865] More than 1,000 police officers were deployed to the match.[1016] BFC Dynamo eventually lost 8–0.[970] The return match was played at the Stadion im Sportforum on 13 May 2006. The score was 1–1 when around 200 supporters of BFC Dynamo stormed the pitch to attack supporters of Union Berlin.[456][871][873] Supporters of Union Berlin fled the guest block in panic.[872] The match was abandoned and Union Berlin was awarded a 2–0 victory.[871][873] The two teams has not met since then.\\n\\nBFC Dynamo met the reserve team of Union Berlin six times in the NOFV-Oberliga Nord and Regionalliga Nordost between 2010 and 2015. Union Berlin II won the first five matches. The last match was played in the 2014-15 Regionalliga Nordost on 15 March 2015. BFC Dynamo defeated Union Berlin II 1–0 in front of 8,169 spectators at Stadion an der Alten Försterei. The match was interrupted for 18 minutes when supporters of Union Berlin tried to attack the supporters of BFC Dynamo.[552][1052][45] 112 police officers were injured and 175 supporters were arrested during the match.[1053][45] Some media reported that 300 supporters of Union Berlin had participated in the attack on guest supporters. Journalist Frank Willmann attended the match and claims that the number was rather 30. He also said he did not see any injured police.[1052] There have been several cases of violence between the supporters of the two teams during the 2010s.[1054] Around a hundred hooligans from Union Berlin tried to attack a senior tournament organized by BFC Dynamo in the Dynamo-Sporthalle on 30 January 2010.[1055][1056][1057][875] Also women and children got in the way of the attack.[1057] Around 30 partially masked supporters from Union Berlin attacked players and a small group of supporters of BFC Dynamo in connection with a senior match between Union Berlin and BFC Dynamo at the Sportanlage Hämmerlingstraße in Köpenick on 27 March 2015.[1058][45][1054] One player of BFC Dynamo and two guest spectators were injured.[45] A number of supporters of BFC Dynamo joined Hertha BSC in the guest block of the Stadion an der Alten Försterei during the derby between Union Berlin and Hertha BSC on 2 November 2019.[899]\\n\\nOrganization\\nCurrent board and management\\nAs of 1 August 2023[1059][1060][1061][1062][1063]\\nBerliner Fussball Club Dynamo e.

The U17 team competes in the third tier B-Junior Verbandsliga Berlin and the U19 team competes in second tier A-Junior Regionalliga Nordost.[1094] The youth teams are based in the Sportforum Hohenschönhausen.[637]\\n\\nThere were more than 800 children and youth players in the club as of 2019.[1095] Many children in the club comes from immigrant backgrounds or socially disadvantaged families.[637][1096][626][753][608][634] BFC Dynamo helped football club FC Berlin 23 from neighbouring Storkower Straße in September 2021 and saved more than 40 to 50 children from the club, which was about to be dissolved.[608]\\n\\nThe club launched the so-called \\\"Kita-projekt\\\" in 2003.[637] The Kita-projekt is a day care project that gives boys and girls aged 3 to 6 the opportunity to participate in sports on a regular basis.[637][1097] The Kita-projekt involved approximately 200 children from 16 day care centers in Berlin as of 2020.[1096] The majority of the children come from the localities or former boroughs of Lichtenberg, Hohenschönhausen, Karlshorst, Mitte, Weißensee and Pankow.[1097] The Kita-projekt was the first of its kind in Germany and has received several awards for its work with children.[637][1098][1099] The former professional player of BFC Dynamo Jörn Lenz is the head of the Kita-projekt as of 2021.[1099]\\n\\nThe so-called \\\"Jugendförderverein\\\" was founded in 2004.[426] It is a registered voluntary association that aims to promote youth sports at BFC Dynamo. The Jugendförderverein has supported youth teams with equipment, covered costs for trips to tournaments and helped youth trainers to be able to obtain their trainer license. The Jugendförderverein relies on donations and voluntary work.[1100] Former Club President Mario Weinkauf was one of the seven founding members of the Jugenförderverein and briefly served as chairman of the association before he became club president. Weinkauf had also been a youth trainer in the club for some time.[426]\\n\\nYouth academy during East German era\\nBFC Dynamo had a very successful youth academy during the East German era.[1016][174][201] The youth department had full-time trainers available for all youth classes and access to the best material conditions in the Dynamo-Sportforum.[105][1101] There were no less than 40 full-time trainers in the club.[928] Youth coaches were highly qualified and training in the Children and Youth Sports School (KJS) was extensive.[1102][1103] The youth work at BFC Dynamo during the East German era was described as \\\"absolutely leading\\\" by former coach Jürgen Bogs, who had a background as coach of the junior team.[105][1101] It was also described as \\\"exquisite\\\" by former German sports journalist Horst Friedemann, who worked for Deutsches Sportecho and Kicker.[201]\\n\\nThe upper tier of elite clubs in East Germany had privileged access to talents within designated geographical and administrative areas.[4][1104] All designated football clubs were assigned one or two regional districts in East Germany as catchment areas at their founding in 1965–1966. BFC Dynamo was initially assigned Bezirk Cottbus and one third of the districts in East Berlin.[35][65] The club was later allowed to take over the training centers (German: Trainingszentrum) (TZ) in East Berlin that had previously belonged to the catchment area of FC Vorwärts Berlin, when FC Vorwärts Berlin was relocated to Frankfurt an der Oder before the 1971-72 season.[64][65]\\n\\nHowever, BFC Dynamo, as well as FC Vorwärts Berlin and SG Dynamo Dresden, also had another structural advantage when it came to recruiting talents.[1105] Most sports associations (German: Sportvereinigung) (SV) were dissolved at the founding of the DTSB in 1957.[1106] However, sports associations SV Dynamo and ASV Vorwärts were allowed to continue exist.[1107] A decision in the SED Politburo in 1962 then stipulated that the sports associations SV Dynamo and ASV Vorwärts were allowed to set up sports communities in each location where they operated offices. This meant that SV Dynamo and ASV Vorwärts would be able to run sports communities across the country.[1108] BFC Dynamo would eventually be able recruit talents from the youth departments of all sports communities (German: Sportgemeinschaft) (SG) of SV Dynamo in East Germany, except those in Bezirk Dresden and a number of other sports communities in the southern regional districts that belonged to the catchment area of SG Dynamo Dresden.[105][4][1109][nb 39]\\n\\nThe basis of the East German selection and screening system in competitive sports would eventually consist of special training centers (TZ).[1113][1114][nb 40] SV Dynamo would operate numerous training centers across the whole of East Germany. The training centers were either assigned to BFC Dynamo or SG Dynamo Dresden, depending on catchment area. Training in these training centers were better than elsewhere. The work in the training centers was supervised and directed by BFC Dynamo. The best talents from the individual training centers were then brought together and selected in a multi-day screening session.[69] BFC Dynamo would come to benefit from a nationwide scouting network, which included the partnership with Bezirk Cottbus and 33 training centers (TZ) of SV Dynamo.[1118][1119][68] In total, BFC Dynamo had access to 38 training centers (TZ) across East Germany for the recruitment of talents. As a comparison, Union Berlin had only access to six training centers (TZ), all of which were located in the Berlin area.[70]\\n\\nA number of football clubs became specially promoted focus clubs in the 1970 DFV Football Resolution.[60][999] The focus clubs would receive additional financial support from the DTSB and other advantages.[998][996] In the 1976 DFV Football Resolution, focus clubs were also allowed delegate youth players from other football clubs.[1001] BFC Dynamo became the focus club in East Berlin. As a focus club, BFC Dynamo had the right to delegate 12 students to its affiliated Children and Youth Sports Schools (KJS) every year.[1109][1002] Non-focus football clubs only had the right to delegate six students to their affiliated Children and Youth Sports School (KJS) every year.[1002] The elite Children and Youth Sports School (KJS) \\\"Werner Seelenbinder\\\" provided boarding and schooling for talented players in the Sportforum.[1120][1121][1107] The Children and Youth Sports School (KJS) \\\"Werner Seelenbinder\\\" was affiliated to sports club SC Dynamo Berlin.[1122]\\n\\nThe success of BFC Dynamo during the East German era was based on the club\'s extensive youth work.[1123][1124][105][201] In 1975, there were as many as five national team players in the East Germany junior national football team among the club\'s youth players from the class of 1957.[98]1 Only a fifth of the players who won the ten East German championships with BFC Dynamo were older than 18 years when they joined the club.[990] The youth academy produced stars such as Lutz Eigendorf, Falko Götz and Andreas Thom.[1120][1016][1102][752] Most of the top performers of BFC Dynamo in the 1980s came through the club\'s own youth teams, including Frank Terletzki, Hans-Jürgen Riediger, Norbert Trieloff, Bodo Rudwaleit, Ralf Sträßer, Artur Ullrich, Rainer Ernst, Bernd Schulz, Christian Backs, Frank Rohde, Falko Götz, Jan Voß, Andreas Thom, Jörg Fügner, Hendrik Herzog and Marco Köller.[1125][1126][1127] Several former players of SC Dynamo Berlin and BFC Dynamo became youth trainers in the club after ending their playing careers, such as Herbert Schoen, Hermann Bley, Günter Schröter, Martin Skaba, Peter Rohde, Werner Voigt, Hartmut Pelka and Hans-Jürgen Riediger.[1128][1129][1125][1130][1131]\\n\\nNumerous players from East Germany joined West German clubs at the end of East Germany. Many came from BFC Dynamo. More than 110 players who had been trained in East Germany, primarily in a Children and Youth Sports School (KJS), would go on to play for West German or West Berlin clubs in the Bundesliga after the end of East Germany. German author Michael Peter has created a database for all players who had been trained in East Germany and who played for West German or West Berlin football clubs after 1990. For players born before 1976, BFC Dynamo was the biggest contributor. 98 players, born before 1976, came from the ten designated football clubs and SG Dynamo Dresden. 18 of these, came from BFC Dynamo.[1108]\\n\\nHonours\\nNext Generation Oberliga (German: Nachwuchsoberliga) (de)[a]\\nWinners: 1981, 1991[b]\\nRunners-up (6): 1979, 1983\\nEast German Junior Championship (de)[c]\\nWinners: (5) 1960,[d] 1978, 1979, 1987, 1991\\nRunners-up (6): 1967, 1974, 1976, 1977, 1988, 1989\\nEast German Youth Championship (Youth FDJ-Pokal) (de)[e]\\nWinners: (4) 1967, 1972, 1975, 1987\\nRunners-up: 1983, 1989\\nEast German Junior Cup (Junge Welt-Pokal) (de)[c]\\nWinners: (5) 1966, 1967, 1987, 1989, 1990[b] (record)\\nEast German Youth Cup (Youth FDGB-Pokal)[e]\\nWinners: (5) 1965,[d] 1968, 1971, 1972, 1976 (record)\\n Corresponds to U21 level. The league existed from 1976 to 1983 and 1989 to 1991. The reserve teams of the 14 DDR-Oberliga clubs were no longer allowed to participate in the DDR-Liga after the 1975-76 season. The Junior Oberliga (de) was also disbanded after the season. The Next Generation Oberliga was introduced instead. Youth teams of the 14 DDR-Oberliga clubs were all were eligible to start in the 1976-77 Next Generation Oberliga. Next Generation Oberliga was disbanded after the 1982-83 season. All teams were instead assigned to the third tier Bezirksliga. BFC Dynamo participted in the 1983-84 Bezirksliga Berlin with reseve team BFC Dynamo II. BFC Dynamo II won the 1983-84 Bezirksliga Berlin and qualified for the 1984-85 DDR-Liga A.\\n Won as FC Berlin.\\n Corresponds to U19 level.\\n Won by SC Dynamo Berlin.\\n Corresponds to U17 level.\\nExplanatory notes\\n This was not the first or last relocation or transfer of entire football teams in East Germany at the time. Sports association SV Deutsche Volkpolizei relocated its three second-tier teams SV Deutsche Volkspolizei Potsdam, SV Deutsche Volkspolizei Weimar and SV Deutsche Volkspolizei Schwerin to sports communities in larger cities during the summer of 1952. SV Deutsche Volkspolizei Potsdam was relocated to Berlin, SV Deutsche Volkspolizei Weimar to Erfurt and SV Deutsche Volkspolizei Schwerin to Rostock.[6]The team of SV Vorwärts der KVP Leipzig was relocated to East Berlin in 1953. The team continued the 1953-54 DDR-Oberliga as SV Vorwärts der KVP Berlin. SV Vorwärts der KVP Berlin then became ASK Vorwärts Berlin, which later became FC Vorwärts Berlin.[7][4] The relatively successful team of BSG Empor Lauter and its place in the DDR-Oberliga was transferred to sports club SC Empor Rostock in 1954. The football department of SC Empor Rostock later became F.C. Hansa Rostock.[8] The team of BSG Turbine Halle and its place in the DDR-Oberliga was transferred to sports club SC Chemie Halle-Leuna in 1954.[9] The football department of SC Chemie Halle-Leuna later became Hallescher FC Chemie.\\n SG Dynamo Dresden itself had a background that involved political interference and player delegations. SG Dynamo Dresden was previously known as SV Deutsche Volkspolizei Dresden. When SG Friedrichstadt was dissolved by East German sports authorities after the 1949–50 DDR-Oberliga, the playing right in the DDR-Oberliga was transferred to SV Deutsche Volkspolizei Dresden.[10][8][11] SV Deutsche Volkspolizei Dresden had previously played in the lower-tier Stadtliga Dresden and was thus able to enter the DDR-Oberliga without having to progress through divisions.[12][13] In order to keep the place in the DDR-Oberliga, the team of SV Deutsche Volkspolizei Dresden would be reinforced with players from Volkspolizei teams all over the country.[14] The head of the Volkspolizei Kurt Fischer ordered that best football players in the sports communities of the Volkspolizei around East Germany should be concentrated in the now first-tier SV Deutsche Volkspolizei Dresden.[15] The 40 best players of the various Volkspolizei teams in East Germany were then brought together for a training session in Forst in July 1950. Coaches Fritz Sack and Paul Döring then picked out 17 players from 11 different cities who were delegated to Dresden to form the team.[16][11] SV Deutsche Volkspolizei Potsdam lost its five best players and was severaly weakened.[13][17]\\n However, newspaper Neues Deutschland reported an attendance number of 60,000 spectators.[20]\\n BFC Dynamo played friendly matches against Pogoń Szczecin in 1966, 1969, 1973, two times in 1975, 1977, two times in 1978, 1980, 1984, 1985, 1986 and 1987.[43]\\n SV Dynamo would eventually operate numerous training centers (TZ) across East Germany. The training centers were divided between BFC Dynamo and SG Dynamo Dresden depending on catchment area.[69]\\n German author Steffen Karas also claims in his book \\\"66 Jahre BFC Dynamo - Auswärts mit \'nem Bus\\\" that BFC Dynamo actually only scored nine match-deciding goals in the 86th minute or later, in the 218 matches it won or drew during its ten championship years. Only one of those goals came from a penalty. That penalty was the controversial penalty against 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig in the 1985-86 DDR-Oberliga on 22 March 1986, which was later proven to be correct.[205]\\n Karin Halsch was known as Karin Seidel-Kalmutzki at the time.[339]\\n Sources vary on the history of the stadium. A few sources state that the stadium was constructed in 1954 and then refurbished in 1973.[685][693] A centrally located football stadium is depicted in the early plans for the Dynamo-Sportforum by architects Walter Schmidt and Heinz Scharlipp.[694] Other sources suggest that the stadium was completed in its current form in 1970.[695][688][696]\\n The capacity was 12,000 at the beginning of the 1966–67 season and 14,000 at the beginning of the 1968–69 season.[706][707]\\n The skinhead movement in East Germany grew out of the punk subculture, and was characterized as an aggressive form of protest.[777][778] It was radicalized in the middle of the 1980s, by a hybrid of ultranationalism, xenophobia and anti-communism.[778] East Berlin was the epicenter of the East German skinhead movement, with BFC Dynamo and 1. FC Union Berlin as its two football magnets.[778][779] The Stasi concluded that about 30-40 skinheads were associated to the two clubs in December 1985. Many were attached to fan cub Anale Berlin at BFC Dynamo.[778] Anale Berlin became infamous for its violence capital and glorification of fascism.[778][779] There were around 300–400 skinheads in East Berlin in December 1987.[780][717] Many were fans of BFC Dynamo.[717] Reports noted a group of roughly 100 skinheads that regularly attended the away matches of BFC Dynamo in 1988.[781] And the Stasi estimated that there were about 30 skinheads among the followers of 1. FC Union Berlin in July 1988.[4][781] Despite the fierce rivalry between BFC Dynamo and 1. FC Union Berlin, there were contacts between skinheads of the two clubs.[32] Far-right skinheads were attached to fan clubs Borussen and Die Löwen at 1. FC Union Berlin.[772][782]\\n However, hooligans of BFC Dynamo and skinheads allegedly attached to the hooligan scene of BFC Dynamo were also involved in serious incidents associated with racism and right wing-extremism in the 1980s. Hooligans of BFC Dynamo attacked 26 Cuban guest workers on train D 1056 towards Berlin-Lichtenberg, while returning from a match in Halle on 12 May 1984.[788][789] The hooligans had allegedly shouted racist slogans and sung the Deutschlandlied. At least nine Cubans were injured.[790] A number of skinheads allegedly attached to the hooligan scene of BFC Dynamo were also among those convicted for the much-publicized attack on a punk concert in the Zionskirche church in East Berlin on 17 October 1987.[178][137] However, incidents associated to racism and right-wing extremism in East German football were not isolated to BFC Dynamo and authorities also recorded the use of racists slogans, such as \\\"Jewish pigs!\\\", by supporters of several other teams at the time, including SG Dynamo Dresden and 1. FC Union Berlin.[791][792][793]\\n Several sources claim that a group of 500 hooligans of BFC Dynamo attacked a gas station, looted shops and attacked the Volkspolizei in Jena in November 1989.[32][799][459][788][798] One source specifically claims that the incidents occurred in connection to an away match in the DDR-Oberliga.[799] However, the sources do not specify any exact date or any details regarding which match the incidents occur in connection with. FC Berlin played away against FC Carl Zeiss Jena in the 18th matchday of the 1989-90 DDR-Oberliga on 8 April 1990.\\n Hooligans in Magdeburg attacked Soviet soldiers on 29 August 1990. One officer fired a warning shot.[803] The police fired warning shots during violent riots after the friendly match between 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig and FC Bayern Munich on 6 September 1990.[803][813][815] The match between FC Sachsen Leipzig and FC Carl Zeiss Jena in the 1990-91 NOFV-Oberliga on 29 September 1990 was abandoned shortly before the end due to violent riots in the stadium.[813][814]\\n However, the high number of supporters of FC Berlin at the scene claimed by the police has been disputed.[820] The number of supporters of FC Berlin on the scene varies between different sources. The police initially stated that they had faced up to 500 hooligans.[817][824] However, an eyewitness stated that the group that arrived at the S-Bahn station and marched towards the stadium rather consisted of only 150 supporters. This group was supposedly met by around 50 police officers outside the stadium.[820] Neues Deutschland reported that the number of rioters outside the stadium \\\"grew to around 400 to 500 hooligans\\\".[819] A common figure is that 400 supporters of FC Berlin arrived at the S-Bahn station after kick-off.[823][802][825][264] A supporter of FC Berlin has said in Zeit that there were almost 500 supporters of FC Berlin outside the stadium.[265]\\n Another legend tells that Erich Mielke made a remark about bringing the title to Berlin after the fractious encounter between Dynamo Dresden and BFC Dynamo on 2 December 1978, when he allegedly walked into the locker room of Dynamo Dresden and told the players that \\\"You must understand, the capital city needs a champion!\\\".[923] However, according to another version, he instead made this remark when the players of Dynamo Dresden celebrated their title in 1978 and he allegedly ghosted into their locker room to inform them that BFC Dynamo will be champions next year.[924] And according to yet another version, this happened instead after BFC Dynamo had won its second title in 1980, when Erich Mielke allegedly told the players of Dynamo Dresden that \\\"One must understand, the capital city needs a champion.\\\"[178] Dynamo Dresden was one point ahead of BFC Dynamo before the last match day of the 1979-80 DDR-Oberliga. BFC Dynamo met Dynamo Dresden home in the last matchday on 10 May 1980. BFC Dynamo won the match 1-0 and captured the league title. Dynamo Dresden player Udo Schmuck remembers how Mielke came into the locker room of Dynamo Dresden after the match with a gold medal around his neck. He allegedly said: \\\"It doesn\'t matter. The main thing is that Dynamo is champion!\\\".[925] Mielke is also said to have told Dynamo Dresden player Hans-Jürgen Dörner at the same occasion; \\\"Comrade Dörner, it is clear to all of you that the title belongs in the capital, now it\'s the turn of the BFC.\\\"[926]\\n Former SG Dynamo Dresden coach Klaus Sammer claimed in an interview with Berliner Zeitung in 2003 that with \\\"a few exceptions\\\", SG Dynamo Dresden was only able to fall back on the Bezirk Dresden as catchment area.[929] However, Bezirk Dresden was one of the most populous regional districts in East Germany. East German sports journalist Horst Friedemann claims that the SV Dynamo sports communities (SG) of Eisleben and Halle/Neustadt also belonged to the catchment area of SG Dynamo Dresden. They were located under the \\\"southern line\\\", where Dresden had access.[930] SG Dynamo Dresden also had access to training centers (TZ) of SV Dynamo. SV Dynamo operated numerous training centers across East Germany. The training centers were either assigned to BFC Dynamo or SG Dynamo Dresden, depending on catchment area.[931] In total, SG Dynamo Dresden had 35 partner associations (German: Partnervereine), including training centers (TZ). Their task was mainly to scout the best players and then send them to Dresden.[932] German sports historian Hanns Leske has categorized SG Dynamo Dresden as the third most privileged football club or sports community in East German football, behind FC Vorwärts Berlin and BFC Dynamo.[933]\\n Supporters of 1. FC Union Berlin used the same provocation at away matches in Saxony, despite their cultivation of their club\'s underdog image. A supporter of 1. FC Union Berlin has testified that they brought Cuban organges and rotten bananas to an away match against FC Karl-Marx-Stadt, fully aware that these fruits were symbols of their privileges as East Berliners.[962]\\n BFC Dynamo was officially a club of the Ministry of the Interior.[973] The official sponsor (German: Träger) of the club was the Volkspolizei.[36] The official sponsor of Union Berlin was the state-owned combine VVB Hochspannungsgeräte und Kabel.[974]\\n The football clubs had been assigned one or two districts in East Germany as catchment areas at their founding. 1. FC Union Berlin had been assigned Bezirk Potsdam and one third of all training centers (TZ) in East Berlin. BFC Dynamo had been assigned Bezirk Cottbus and one third of training centers (TZ) in East Berlin. BFC Dynamo now had access to Bezirk Cottbus and two thirds of all training centers (TZ) in East Berlin. 1. FC Union Berlin on the other hand had to make do with its training centers (TZ) in East Berlin.[35][970]\\n FC Vorwärts Berlin was initially a focus club in East Berlin.[1000] The only major club in East Berlin that was never appointed as focus club was 1. FC Union Berlin.[60] FC Vorwärts Berlin continued to be part of the group of focus clubs after its relocation to Frankfurt an der Oder.[1000]\\n Football clubs were given performance assignments from the DTSB that had to be fulfilled. The clubs then had to report on the fulfillment in two-year analyzes. Union Berlin had the objective in 1977-78 of producing four players who could be delegated to the focus club BFC Dynamo. Union Berlin explained that its downward trend in the youth area was due to the fact that the club had to delegate its two best players to the focus club every year and that the club could only rely on four districts in East Berlin for further selection.[978]\\n The club management of 1. FC Union Berlin seriously considered moving all matches to Stadion der Weltjugend after a stormy encounter with BSG Wismut Aue in 1976.[1007]\\n Manfred Kirste was the first president and is the longest serving president. He served as president from 15 January 1966 to 30 August 1988.\\n Served as president until 19 Februari 1990.[1064]\\n Became acting president after the dismissal of Herbert Krafft on 19 February 1990. Bogs served as acting president until 27 May 1990.[1064]\\n Dr. Klaus Janz served as president until 15 October 1990.[1065] He asked to be relieved from the office due to professional stress as a lawyer. He continued as vice president.[1066]\\n Dr. Wolfgang Hösrich became president on 15 October 1990. He had a background as a club doctor for SC Dynamo Berlin and BFC Dynamo. Hösrich had previously served as vice president.[1067][1066] The presidium under Dr. Wolfgang Hösrich was replaced by a new presidium under Eberhard Landmann on 20 May 1994.[1068][1069][1070]\\n Eberhard Landmann became president on 20 May 1994.[1071] Landmann was a former insurance salesman. He only served as president for nine months.[1068][1069][1072]\\n Klaus Bittroff was elected as the new president on 10 February 1995 with the votes 73-11. Volkmar Wanski was elected as one of two vice presidents alongside re-elected Lutz Hoff.[1073][1072][1071] Bittroff had previously served as president of Wacker 04 Berlin from 1984 to 1991.[1071]\\n Became new president after the resignation of Klaus Bittroff on 14 September 1995.[287] Wanski resigned on 29 June 2000.[335][1072][1074]\\n Sports director Hans Reker was appointed acting president by the Economic council following the resignation of Volkmar Wanski on 29 June 2000.[335][1074] Karin Halsch took office as new president on 27 September 2000.[339]\\n Karin Halsch was known as Karin Seidel-Kalmutzki during the era. Served from 27 September 2000 to 25 June 2001.[339][1075]\\n Sports director Hans Reker served as acting president following the resignation of Karin Halsch on 25 June 2001.[1075][356] Hans Reker held the position of vice president in the presidium of Karin Halsch.[1076][346] He resigned together with the entire presidium on 30 October 2001.[376] An emergency board formed by André Sommer, Rayk Bernt and press spokesman Holger Zimmermann took office. The emergency board was meant to serve until the extraordinary general meeting on 26 November 2001.[376][387]\\n An emergency board formed by André Sommer, Rayk Bernt and press spokesman Holger Zimmermann took office on 1 November 2001. No new president was appointed for the transitional board.[376][387] Zimmerman soon resigned on 23 November 2001.[653] A new presidium was due to be elected on the extraordinary general meeting on 26 November 2001. However, the meeting agenda was changed with the votes 87 to 59 at the insistence of the emergency board. The meeting was converted into an information event and new elections were postponed.[653][1077] Club members collected signatures for the election of a new presidium. But the signatures would be ignored by Sommer and Bernt.[388] The Sommer and Bernt presidium was finally overthrown by supporters and the former coach of the women\'s team Volkmar Lucius after an application to the Charlottenburg district court.[388][401] The Charlottenburg district court appointed Lucius as emergency board member.[388] A new presidium was elected on the extraordinary general meeting on 31 May 2002.[1078]\\n Elected on an extraordinary general meeting on 31 May 2002.[1078]\\n Mario Weinkauf was elected president on 18 June 2004.[426] He resigned on a meeting with the presidium on 22 June 2007. He was then dismissed in a vote of no-confidence on an extra-ordinary general meeting on 23 June 2007. Mario Weinkauf was succeeded by Volkmar Wanski as interim president. Volkmar Wanski had been co-opted into the presidium and elected as the provisional successor to Mario Weinkauf on the meeting with the presidium on 22 June 2007. However the interim presidency of Volkmar Wanski was controversial. It was put into question whether his election was compliant with club statutes. Volkmar Wanski resigned after only six days.[1079][1080][1081]\\n Frank Bertron was launched as interim president by the Economic Council under Peter Meyer.[487][1081] He was presented as new president on 28 June 2007.[1081]\\n Norbert Uhlig is the second longest serving president after Manfred Kirste. Norbert Uhlig has been president since 11 October 2008.[1082]\\n German sports historian Hanns Leske writes that BFC Dynamo was able to recruit young players from the youth departments of all sports communities (SG) of SV Dynamo in East Germany, except those in Bezirk Dresden.[1110] German author Anne Hahn writes that the training centers (TZ) of SV Dynamo across East Germany were divided between BFC Dynamo and SG Dynamo Dresden. She writes that the catchment area of BFC Dynamo included the SV Dynamo sports communities (SG) of Rostock-Mitte, Neustrelitz, Fürstenwalde, Schwerin and Berlin. The best talents were brought together in these training centers and then selected in a central, multi-day screening courses.[931] Also Horst Friedemann claims that the catchment area of BFC Dynamo included the SV Dynamo sports communities (SG) of Rostock-Mitte, Neustrelitz, Fürstenwalde and Schwerin. According to Friedemann, the SV Dynamo sports communities (SG) of Eisleben and Halle/Neustadt instead belonged to the catchment area of SG Dynamo Dresden. That was the \\\"southern line\\\", where Dresden had access.[1111][1112]\\n The training centers (TZ) were the first preparatory stage for the support of children found suitable for sports. Training in training centers usually started at the age of 10.[1115] The training course usually lasted for three to four years.[1115] From the training centers, the best young talents could then be delegated to a Children and Youth Sports School (KJS) and a Sports club (SC) or a Football club (FC).[1116][1113][1117]\\nReferences\\nTemplate:Reflist\\n\\nFurther reading\\nTemplate:Cite news\\nBertram, Marco (2015).

SC Dynamo Berlin was founded on 1 October 1954 as one of the new elite sports clubs in East Germany.[2] The sports club was affiliated to sport association SV Dynamo. In order to establish a competitive side in Berlin, the team of SG Dynamo Dresden and its place in the DDR-Oberliga was transferred to the new sports club SC Dynamo Berlin. The relocation was designed to give the capital a team that would rival teams from West Berlin such as Hertha BSC, which were still popular in East Berlin.[3][4][5][nb 1][nb 2]\\n\\n\\nGünter Schröter (left), Horst Kohle of ASK Vorwärts Berlin (centre) and Martin Skaba (right) during a match between Vorwärts Berlin and Dynamo Berlin at the Walther-Ulbricht-Stadion on 18 October 1959\\nThe team played its first match as SC Dynamo Berlin against BSG Rotation Babelsberg in the 1954-55 DDR-Oberliga on 21 November 1954. Among the players delegated from SG Dynamo Dresden were Johannes Matzen, Herbert Schoen and Günter Schröter. SC Dynamo Berlin finished its first season in the DDR-Oberliga in seventh place. The team was relatively successful in the 1955 DDR-Oberliga, but suffered relegation to the second tier DDR-Liga after the 1956 DDR-Oberliga. SC Dynamo Berlin played a friendly match against Polish side Górniczy KS Szombierki Bytom in front of 80,000 spectators at the Walter-Ulricht-Stadion on 9 May 1957.[18][19] The attendance number is allegedly the highest in the history of the club.[19][nb 3] SC Dynamo Berlin eventually finished the 1957 DDR-Liga in first place immediately returned to the DDR-Oberliga.\\n\\nGünter Schröter and Herbert Maschke would remain central players to the team into early the 1960s. But most other players of the former SG Dynamo Dresden team were no longer active in the team by the late 1950s.[21] Herbert Schoen had played his last competitive matches for the team during the 1957 season and Johannes Matzen had suffered a serious injury during the 1958 season and consequently had to end his playing career.[22] The team was now instead shaped by a new generation of players, including Martin Skaba, Werner Heine, Waldemar Mühlbächer, Hermann Bley and Konrad Dorner (de).[23]\\n\\n\\nThe team of SC Dynamo Berlin after winning the 1959 FDGB-Pokal, at the Bruno-Plache-Stadion in Leipzig on 13 December 1959\\nSC Dynamo Berlin had difficulties establishing itself in football in East Berlin.[17] The team rarely drawing crowds larger than 5,000 spectators at the Walter-Ulbricht-Stadion. SC Dynamo Berlin finally won its first trophy in the 1959 FDGB-Pokal. However, the team would not be allowed to participate in the 1960-61 European Cup Winners\' Cup. The East German Football Association (DFV) found local rival and league runner-up ASK Vorwärts Berlin to be a more suitable representative of East Germany in the competition.[24]\\n\\nSC Dynamo Berlin also had some success in the first seasons of the 1960s. The team fished the 1960 DDR-Oberliga as runner-up. SC Dynamo Berlin was a top team also in the 1961-62 DDR-Oberliga. The team participated in the 1961–62 International Football Cup during the summer of 1961. SC Dynamo Berlin was successful in 1961-62 FDGB-Pokal. The team was only defeated 1-3 by SC Chemie Halle in the final.[25] However, SC Dynamo Berlin still found itself overshadowed in the capital by the army-sponsored ASK Vorwärts Berlin.[26] The team of SC Dynamo Berlin during the 1960s would eventually prove relatively weak.[27] SC Dynamo Berlin had become a lower table side by the end of the 1962–63 Oberliga.[21]\\n\\nEast German football was reformed in 1965–66, when the football departments of ten sports clubs (SC) were made independent from their sports clubs to form ten dedicated football clubs. The new designated football clubs (FC) would form the elite of East German football. As part of the reorganization, the football section of SC Dynamo Berlin was separated from the sports club and reorganized as football club BFC Dynamo.[28][29][4][30] The football department of sports community SG Dynamo Hohenschönhausen was also disbanded after the 1965–66 season. The players of SG Dynamo Hochenschönhausen joined the reserve team BFC Dynamo II and BFC Dynamo II took over the place of SG Dynamo Hohenschönhausen in the 1966-67 Bezirksliga Berlin.\\n\\nFounding and second relegation (1966–1967)\\nBFC Dynamo was founded on 15 January 1966.[31] The new club was presented by the President of SV Dynamo Erich Mielke at a ceremony in the Dynamo-Sporthalle in Hohenschönhausen in East Berlin.[32] The first presidium included the Head of the Volkspolizei in East Berlin Horst Ende, the Intendant of the Metropol theatre Hans Pitra, former DDR-Oberliga player Johannes Matzen and the Editor-in-chief of the East German football weekly Die Neue Fußballwoche (FuWo) (de) Klaus Schlegel.[33] Manfred Kirste was elected club president and Mielke was elected honorary president.[32][31] Kirste came from Berlin and was a certified sports teacher.[34]\\n\\n\\nThe match between BFC Dynamo and FC Vorwärts Berlin in the DDR-Oberliga at the Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum on 13 August 1966\\nThe new designated football clubs (FC) were formed as centers of excellence in East German football, with the right to draw on talents within designated geographical and administrative areas.[4][29] BFC Dynamo was initiallly assigned Bezirk Cottbus and one third of East Berlin as catchment area.[35] BFC Dynamo was officially a club of the Ministry of the Interior, and the club\'s official sponsor was the Volkspolizei.[36][37] However, the honorary chairman Mielke was the head of the Stasi and most of the club\'s sponsoring members would eventually be made up of Stasi employees. BFC Dynamo would come to receive personal, organizational and financial support from the Stasi.[37][38] Research by the Stasi Records Agency has shown that 31 employees of the Ministry of the Interior and ten employees of the Stasi would eventually be involved in the club.[39]\\n\\nSC Dynamo Berlin had been in first place in the 1965-66 DDR-Oberliga after the eighth matchday.[40] BFC Dynamo were still in a good fourth place after a 2–0 win over BSG Chemie Leipzig on the 23rd matchday on 16 April 1966. However, the team then lost its last three matches in the league, against F.C. Hansa Rostock, SG Dynamo Dresden and FC Rot-Weiß Erfurt, and finished the season in ninth place.[41]\\n\\nHungarian Bela Volentik was new coach for the 1966–67 season. The team played a friendly match against Polish side Pogoń Szczecin on 10 September 1966. The match would be one of many in a long series of friendly maches against Pogoń Szczecin during the East German era.[42][nb 4] The team struggled in the 1966-67 DDR-Oberliga. BFC Dynamo faced local rivals 1. FC Union Berlin away on the 22nd matchday on 26 April 1967. BFC Dynamo was in 13th place in the league and threatened with relegation.[44][45] Supporters of 1. FC Union Berlin mocked the team with a banner saying \\\"We greet the relegated\\\". 1. FC Union Berlin won the match 3-0 and BFC Dynamo was now practically relegated.[45] The match is seen as the starting point for the feud between the two clubs.[45] BFC Dynamo eventually finished the 1966-67 DDR-Oberliga in 13th place and was again relegated to the DDR-Liga. Long-time player Waldemar Mühlbächer retired from his playing career after the season.[46] Mühlbächer had joined SC Dynamo Berlin in 1956 and had played 11 seasons for the team.[47]\\n\\nRejuvenation and first UEFA competition (1967–1972)\\nFormer SC Dynamo Berlin forward Karl Schäffner returned as coach for the 1967–68 season.[48] BFC Dynamo dominated the 1967-68 DDR-Liga Nord. The team was undefeated during the second half of the league season and immediately won promotion back to the DDR-Oberliga.[49] Forward Peter Lyszczan became tied league top goalscorer in the 1967-68 DDR-Liga Nord with 19 goals.[50] Martin Skaba and Hermann Bley retired after the 1967–68 season and Konrad Dorner was transferred to the reserve team BFC Dynamo II.[51] The three had joined SC Dynamo Berlin between 1956 and 1958. Skaba had played in a total of 343 matches for the team.[52]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo began a rejuvenation of the team during the 1967–68 season.[51] Among the players from the youth department who got to play matches in the 1967-68 DDR-Liga Nord were Harald Schütze (de), Norbert Johannsen and Werner Voigt.[53] BFC Dynamo fielded a young team in the 1968–69 season. The average age of the team was 23 years at the start of the season.[54] Harald Schütze was now a regular player in the team.[51] BFC Dynamo got off to a difficult start on its return to the DDR-Oberliga. Hans Geitel took over as coach for the second half of the season. Geitel had previously worked in the youth academy of BFC Dynamo.[55] The team finished the 1968-69 DDR-Oberliga in tenth place.\\n\\nBFC Dynamo recruited young forward Ralf Schulenberg from FC Rot-Weiß Erfurt for the 1969–70 season.[56] Schulenberg was probably compensation for the talented Günter Wolff, who had left BFC Dynamo for FC Rot-Weiß Erfurt after the 1967–68 season.[55] A number of players from the youth departments would also make their debut in the DDR-Oberliga in the following seasons, such as Peter Rohde (de) in 1969, Frank Terletzki in 1969 and Bernd Brillat in 1970. BFC Dynamo reached the final of the 1970-71 FDGB-Pokal. The team lost the final 1–2 in overtime to SG Dynamo Dresden, but qualified for the next season\'s UEFA Cup Winners\' Cup as runner-up.[57] This time, the team would also be allowed to participate in the competition, unlike in 1960. BFC Dynamo was thus finally ready for its first participation in an UEFA competition.[58]\\n\\nA number of football clubs became specially promoted focus clubs (German: Schwerpunktclubs) in the 1970 DFV Football Resolution (German: DFV-Fußballbeschluss).[59][60] BFC Dynamo and FC Vorwärts Berlin became focus clubs in East Berlin.[60][61] The football landscape in East Berlin would then change dramatically ahead of the 1971–72 season, when the Ministry of Defense decided to relocate FC Vortwärts Berlin to Frankfurt an der Oder.[62][63] BFC Dynamo and 1. FC Union Berlin were from now on the only major football clubs in East Berlin.[64] BFC Dynamo would be allowed to take over the catchment area in East Berlin that had previously belonged to FC Vorwärts Berlin.[65][64] The team would also have the opportunity to play more matches at the larger and more centrally located Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark in Prenzlauer Berg, which led to increased interest in the club and growing attendance numbers.[66]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo stood out among other teams within SV Dynamo. BFC Dynamo was located at the frontline of the Cold War. It was also a representative of the East German capital. This meant that the club had to be well equipped.[67] BFC Dynamo would eventually get access to a nationwide scouting network, including numerous training centers (German: Trainingszentrum) (TZ) of SV Dynamo across East Germany.[68][nb 5] BFC Dynamo would eventually be able to recruit young talented players from 38 training centers (TZ) across East Germany. By comparison, 1. FC Union Berlin only had access to 6 training centers (TZ), all of which were located in the Berlin area.[70]\\n\\nThe team was joined by forward Wolf-Rüdiger Netz from SG Dynamo Schwerin for the 1971–72 season. Among the central players in the team in the 1971–72 season were Werner Lihsa, Harald Schütze, Frank Terletzki, Dieter Stumpf, Norbert Johannsen, Peter Rohde, Wilfried Trümpler, Joachen Carow, Wolf-Rüdiger Netz and Ralf Schulenberg.[71] BFC Dynamo had success in the 1971–72 UEFA Cup Winners\' Cup. The team eliminated Cardiff City F.C. in the first round and then K Beerschot VA in the second round. BFC Dynamo would now also show its strength in the DDR-Oberliga. The team was unbeaten in the first six league matches after the winter break, including wins against top teams 1. FC Magdeburg and SG Dynamo Dresden.[72] The team eliminated Åtvidabergs FF in the quarter-finals of the 1971–72 UEFA Cup Winners\' Cup and advanced to the semi-finals.[73] BFC Dynamo thus became the first team from Berlin to reach the semi-finals in one of the two most prestigious UEFA competitions (the European Cup and the European Cup Winners\' Cup). BFC Dynamo was eventually eliminated by Dynamo Moscow in the semi-finals after a penalty shoot-out at the Druzhba Stadium in Lviv in the return leg on 20 April 1972.[74] The team finished the 1971-72 DDR-Oberliga as runner-up.\\n\\nRise in the DDR-Oberliga (1972–1978)\\nBFC Dynamo was qualified for the 1972-73 UEFA Cup.

FC Union Berlin for the 1984–85 season.[151] The team was drawn against Aberdeen FC under Alex Ferguson in the first round of the 1984–85 European Cup.[155] The team lost the first leg 2–1 away.[156][157] BFC Dynamo eventually won the round after dramatic penalty shoot-out at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark in the return leg. Goalkeeper Bodo Rudwaleit saved the last two penalty kicks for Aberdeen FC.[158][159][157] BFC Dynamo was neck-to-neck with SG Dynamo Dresden in the first half of the 1984-85 DDR-Oberliga. BFC Dynamo eventually finished the 1984-85 DDR-Oberliga in first place, six points ahead of SG Dynamo Dresden, and won its seventh consecutive league title. The team had scored a total of 90 goals during the league season, which set a new record for the number of goals in one DDR-Oberliga season.[160] No team would ever score more goals in one season in the DDR-Oberliga. Rainer Ernst was once again the best goal scorer in the league with 24 goals. Frank Pastor was the second best goal scorer in the league with 22 goals.[161] BFC Dynamo reached the final of the FDGB-Pokal for a second consecutive season and once again faced rival SG Dynamo Dresden in the final. BFC Dynamo lost the final of the 1984-85 FDGB-Pokal 2–3.[162]\\n\\n\\nThe match between 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig and BFC Dynamo on 22 March 1986.\\nBFC Dynamo was already eliminated in the first round of the 1985-86 European Cup by Austria Wien. The team faced stiff competition from SG Dynamo Dresden during the first half of the 1985-86 DDR-Oberliga. Youg defender Jörg Fügner from the youth departent made his debut for BFC Dynamo in the DDR-Oberliga towards the end of the first half of the season.[163] BFC Dynamo was in first place in the league before the winter break.[164] The team faced fourth-placed 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig on the 18th matchday. 1. FC Lokomotiv Leipzig led the match 1–0 in overtime. BFC Dynamo was then awarded a penalty in the 94th minute.[165] Frank Pastor safely converted the penalty and the match ended in a 1–1 draw.[166] The penalty was highly controversial and would later become known as the \\\"Shame penalty of Leipzig\\\".[167] BFC Dynamo also faced 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig in the two-legged semi-finals of the 1985-86 FDGB-Pokal. BFC Dynamo was eliminated on the away goals rule. 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig had scored a total of three goals on penalties in the semi-finals.[168][169] BFC Dynamo managed to secure its eighth consecutive league title on the final matchday of the 1985-86 DDR-Oberliga.[170][171] The team finished just two points ahead of runners-up 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig. Long time-player Frank Terletzki retired from his playing career after the season. Terletzki had played in a total of 489 matches for BFC Dynamo since 1969.[172]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo had the best material conditions in the league and the best team by far.[173] But controversial refereeing decisions in favor of BFC Dynamo gave rise to speculation that the dominance of BFC Dynamo was not solely due to athletic performance, but also due to help from referees.[174] BFC Dynamo was a representative of both the Stasi and the capital. The team was therefore viewed with more suspicion than affection.[175][174] The overbearing success of BFC Dynamo in the 1980s made fans of opposing teams easily aroused as to what they saw as manipulation by bent referees.[173][176] The team was met with aggression and shouts such as \\\"Bent champions!\\\" (German: Schiebermeister) and \\\"Jews Berlin!\\\" at away matches.[177][4][178][179] Complaints of alleged referee bias accumulated.[173][4][180] The German Football Association of the GDR (DFV) eventually conducted a secret review of the 1984-85 DDR-Oberliga.[173][167][181] Among other things, the review found that BFC Dynamo had earned only one third of the yellow cards incurred by rival SG Dynamo Dresden.[182][183][181] A review was also made of the final of the 1984-85 FDGB-Pokal final between BFC Dynamo and SG Dynamo Dresden. This review found that 30 percent of the referee decisions were wrong, and that 80 percent of those had been of disadvantage to SG Dynamo Dresden.[184][185][186][181] A number of referees were sanctioned for their performances in matches involving BFC Dynamo in the following months, including the referees involved in the cup final.[4][186][181]\\n\\nA particularly controversial episode was the penalty awarded to BFC Dynamo by referee Bernd Stumpf in extra time in the match between 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig and BFC Dynamo on 22 March 1986. The penalty caused a wave of protests.[167][187][174] SED General Secretary Erich Honecker and Secretary for Security, Youth and Sport of the SED Central Committee Egon Krenz were fed up with the \\\"football question\\\" and the \\\"BFC-discussion\\\".[167] An example was consequently made out of referee Stumpf. He was permanently banned from refereeing by the DFV.[165] The sanctions against Stumpf were approved by Honecker and Krenz in the SED Central Committee.[188][189] However, a previously unknown video recording of the match was published by Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk (MDR) in 2000. The video recording showed that the penalty was correctly awarded and that the sanctions against Stumpf were unjustified.[165][178][190]\\n\\n\\\"I can imagine there was referee manipulation due to the immense pressure from the government and Ministry for State Security. That could have made some referees nervous and influenced their decisions. But we were the strongest team at the time. We didn\'t need their help.\\\"\\n\\nFalko Götz[191]\\nThe benefit of controlling important matches in Western Europe might have put indirect pressure on the referees to take preventive measures, in so-called preventive obedience.[192][193][194][195][175] In order pursue an international career, a referee would need a travel permit, confirmed by the Stasi.[188][181][196] It become known after the German reunification that several referees had also been Unofficial collaborators (IM) of the Stasi.[167][197][198][199] However, there is no evidence to show that referees were under direct instructions from the Stasi and no document has ever been found in the archives that gave the Stasi a mandate to bribe referees.[197][194][200][201]\\n\\nThe picture that the success of BFC Dynamo relied upon referee bias is dismissed by former BFC Dynamo players and coaches. Some of them admit that there might have been cases of referee bias, but they all insist that it was the thoroughness of their youth work and the quality of their play that earned them their titles.[202][174][191][203] Former coach Jürgen Bogs has said: \\\"You cannot postpone 26 matches in one season in the DDR-Oberliga. At that time we had the best football team\\\".[204][190][nb 6] BFC Dynamo was able to filter the best talents through nationwide screening and train them in its youth academy. The youth academy had full-time trainers employed for every age group.[206] As a trainer of the DDR-Oberliga team, Bogs worked with modern training methods, such as video evalutations, which was not yet common in East Germany. The club also applied heart rate and lactate measurements during training, which only came to the Bundesliga many years later.[207][190] Former referee Bernd Heynemann has concluded: \\\"The BFC is not ten times champions because the referees only whistled for Dynamo. They were already strong as a bear.\\\"[208]\\n\\nLast titles in East Germany (1986–1989)\\n\\nMarco Köller (left) and Heiko Scholz of 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig (right) during the match between the two teams on 22 August 1987.\\nFrank Rohde was the new team captain for the 1986–87 season.[209] BFC Dynamo recruited 20-year-old attacking midfielder Thomas Doll from relegated F.C. Hansa Rostock for of the 1986–87 season.[209] Doll and Andreas Thom would form one of the most effective attacking duos in East German football in the late 1980s. BFC Dynamo defeated 1. FC Union Berlin 8–1 in the derby on the fourth matchday of the 1986-87 DDR-Oberliga.[210][211] The East Germany U19 team won the 1986 UEFA European Under-18 Championship, after defeating Italy 3–1 in the final on 15 October 1986. BFC Dynamo was represented by two youth players in the squad: midfielder Marco Köller and defender Hendrik Herzog.[212] [213] Köller and Herzog would then make their debuts for BFC Dynamo in the DDR-Oberliga during the 1986–87 season.[214][215] The team met fierce competition from 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig in the 1986–87 DDR-Oberliga. BFC Dynamo met 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig away on the 20th matchday at the Bruno-Plache-Stadion on 11 April 1987.[216] The two teams had the same number of points going into the match.[217] BFC Dynamo won the match 1–3.[216] The team eventually finished the 1986-87 DDR-Oberliga in first place, 6 points ahead of runner-up SG Dynamo Dresden and 8 points ahead of third-placed 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig.[218]\\n\\n\\nAndreas Thom during a match against SG Dynamo Dresden on 6 April 1988.\\nBFC Dynamo was eliminated in the first round of the 1987-88 European Cup after double defeats against FC Girondins de Bordeaux. Also the 1987-88 DDR-Oberliga meant firece competition from 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig. BFC Dynamo finished the first half of the season as Herbstmeister. The team had the same number of points as second-placed 1. FC Lokomotiv Leipzig and led the league only on goal difference.[219] Andreas Thom was the top scorer in the league by a wide margin, with 14 goals in 13 games in the first half of the season.[220] The second half of the 1987-88 DDR-Oberliga was a tight race against 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig until the end. BFC Dynamo and 1. FC Lokomotive were level on points heading into the final matchday, but BFC Dynamo had the better goal difference.[221] BFC Dynamo defeated FC Vorwärts Frankfurt 1–0 at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark on the final matchday and won its tenth consecutive DDR-Oberliga title. The winning goal was scored by Burkhard Reich.[222] The team then defeated FC Carl Zeiss Jena 2–0 in front of 40,000 spectators at the Stadion der Weltjugend in the final of the 1987–88 FDGB-Pokal and finally completed the Double.[223] Andreas Thom was eventually voted the 1988 East German footballer of the year.[224]\\n\\n\\nAndreas Thom receiving the 1988 East German footballer of the year award from the Die Neue Fußballwoche (de) editor-in-chief Jürgen Nöldner on 13 August 1988.\\nLong-time club president Manfred Kirste was replaced by Herbert Krafft ahead of the 1988–89 season.[225] Krafft had a background in the Volkspolizei.[226] BFC Dynamo was drawn against West German champions SV Werder Bremen in the first round of the 1988-89 European Cup. The first match was played at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark. Among the spectators was the former West German Chancellor Willy Brandt. BFC Dynamo sensationally won the match 3–0.[227] Bodo Rudwaleit was a match hero, with numerous saves.[228] However, the team lost the return leg at the Weser-Stadion with 5–0. The return leg in Bremen would become known as the second \\\"Miracle on the Weser\\\".[228][227] It has been rumored that the spectacular loss in the return leg was explained by BFC Dynamo having been given doping before the home game in East Berlin.[105][229] A more likely explanation, however, is that the players could not cope with the enormous pressure before the return leg.[229] It has also been rumored that the players were distracted from their pre-match preparations by shopping opportunities, which had been arranged by SV Werder Bremen manager Willi Lemke.[229][230] BFC Dynamo lost important points to its league rivals in the autumn and finished the first half of the season in fourth place, a full nine points behind SG Dynamo Dresden. It was the team\'s worst result after a first half of the season in the league in 14 years.[231]\\n\\nAverage attendance had dropped from 15,000 to 9,000 during the team\'s most successful years in the 1980s.[173] Ordinary fans feared the Stasi and had become disillusioned with political interference. Particularly aggravating were the restrictions on ticket sales that the Stasi imposed at international matches for political reasons. Only a few tickets were sold to ordinary fans for matches in the European Cup against opponents such as Hamburger SV and SV Werder Bremen. The majority was instead sold to a politically hand-picked audience.[190][232] BFC Dynamo also saw the emergence of a well-organized hooligan scene during the 1980s.[174][178] The development was partly a response to the increasing state repression against the supporter scene.[190]\\n\\n\\nThe team celebrates the victory in the 1988-89 FDGB-Pokal at the Stadion der Weltjugend on 1 April 1989.\\nBFC Dynamo met local rival 1. FC Union Berlin on the 16th matchday of the 1988-89 DDR-Oberliga on 18 March 1989. 1. FC Union Berlin now fielded as many as four former BFC Dynamo players in the starting line-up: Olaf Seier, Mario Maek, Thomas Grether and Norbert Trieloff.[233] BFC Dynamo reached the final of the FDGB-Pokal for the second consecutive season. The team met Karl-Marx-Stadt in the final of the 1988-89 FDGB-Pokal. BFC Dynamo won the match 1–0 in front of 35,000 spectators at the Stadion de Weltjugend and captured its second consecutive cup title. The winning goal was scored by Anderas Thom in the 57th minute.[234] BFC Dynamo eventually finished the 1988-89 DDR-Oberliga as runner-up. Defender Jens-Uwe Zöphel and midfielder Jörn Lenz from the youth department made their debuts for BFC Dynamo in the DDR-Oberliga during the 1988–89 season.[235][236]\\n\\nHelmut Jäschke replaced Jürgen Bogs as coach for the 1989–90 season.[237] As the winner of the 1988-89 FDGB-Pokal, BFC Dynamo was set to play the DFV-Supercup against new league champions SG Dynamo Dresden. The match was played at the Stadion der Freundschaft in Cottbus on 5 August 1989.[238] BFC Dynamo won the match 4-1 and thus became the first and only winner of the DFV-Supercup in the history of East German football.\\n\\nGerman reunification and decline (1989–2004)\\nMain article: History of Berliner FC Dynamo (1989–2004)\\nThe Peaceful revolution, FC Berlin and failed promotion (1989–1991)\\n\\nThe new BFC Dynamo coach Helmut Jäschke during the match against FC Rot-Weiß Erfurt on the first matchday of the 1989-90 DDR-Oberliga on 12 August 1989\\nThe 1989–90 season was tumultuous for BFC Dynamo. Frank Pastor was transferred to BSG Aktivist Schwarze Pumpe at the beginning of the season. BFC Dynamo was qualified for the 1989–90 European Cup Winners\' Cup as winners of the 1988–89 FDGB-Pokal. The team was eliminated in the second round by AS Monaco on the away goals rule. Coach Helmut Jäschke then decided to place young goalkeeper Oskar Kosche in the following match. Long-time goalkeeper Bodo Rudwaleit ten suddenly announced his immediate retirement from football.[239] The East German regime faltered under pressure from political mass demonstrations and events in neighboring countries. Parts of the Berlin Wall were opened on 9 November 1989 and East German citizens could now freely travel to West Berlin. The Stasi was transformed into the Office for National Security (German: Amt für Nationale Sicherheit) (AfNS) on 17 November 1989.[240] The transformation also ended the tenure of Erich Mielke as Minister of State Security.[241] He would soon be dismissed as the First Chairman of SV Dynamo as well.[242][226] Andreas Thom was signed to Bayer Leverkusen by Bayer Leverkusen manager Reiner Calmund. The transfer became official on 12 December 1989. Thom thus became the first player in the DDR-Oberliga to leave for the West German Bundesliga.[243] The transfer fee amounted to 2,5 million Deutsche Mark.[243]\\n\\n\\nThe team of FC Berlin at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark on 23 February 1990.\\nBodo Rudwaleit was transferred to BSG Stahl Einsenhüttenstadt and Bernd Schulz to BSG Bergmann-Borsig during the 1989–1990 winter break. The dismantling of the team from the 1980s was now well underway.[244] Coach Jäschke was dismissed during the winter break and was replaced by Peter Rohde.[245] Rohde had played 159 league- and 14 international matches for BFC Dynamo between 1969 and 1978 and was an older brother of team captain Frank Rohde.[245] The AfNS was eventually completely dissolved on 13 January 1990.[240] With the dissolution of the Stasi, BFC Dynamo had lost a major sponsor. The Ministry of the Interior announced that it was only prepared to support the club until the end of the 1989–90 season.[246][247][248] The fate of the club was uncertain. BFC Dynamo was rebranded as FC Berlin on 19 February 1990.[249][250] Club President Herbert Krafft was dismissed at the same time and Jürgen Bogs took over as interim president until new club elections could be held.[249] The team participated in the first edition of the indoor tournament \\\"Internationales Berliner Hallenfussballurnier\\\" in the Werner-Seelenbinder-Halle. Teams from West Berlin, such as Hertha BSC also participated. FC Berlin lost the final against arch-rival 1. FC Union Berlin with 4–5. Thomas Doll became the best goal scorer of the tournament with 12 goals.[251] The second half of the season started well, but it soon became clear that FC Berlin would not would not have a chance at the title.[252] FC Berlin finished the 1989-90 DDR-Oberliga in fourth place and failed for the first time in a long time to qualify for a European tournament.[253] Attendance dropped from 7,271 in the fall of 1989 to just 3,383 in the spring of 1990.[254] The team lost Thomas Doll and Frank Rohde to Hamburger SV and Rainer Ernst to 1. FC Kaiserslautern after the season.[255][256]\\n\\n\\nDirk Rehbein chasing the ball during a match between FC Berlin and HFC Chemie at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark on 10 November 1990.\\nThe team was joined by Dirk Rehbein from SC Fortuna Köln during the summer of 1990. FC Berlin participated in the 1990 Intertoto Cup 30 June 1990 and 17 July 1990. FC Berlin had sold off almost all its offensive players during the 1989–90 season and the team finished the tournament in third place.[257][258][259] FC Berlin also recruited Mikhail Pronichev from FC Lokomotiv Moscow for the 1990–91 season.[260][261] The team began the 1990-91 NOFV-Oberliga with four consecutive defeats and was in last place in the league after the fourth matchday. Jürgen Bogs returned as coach.[262][263] A wave of hooliganism swept through East Germany in 1990.[178] One of the largest hooligan scenes in Germany was formed around FC Berlin.[253] 18-year-old FC Berlin supporter Mike Polley was shot dead by police during riots in Leutzsch in connection with the match between FC Sachsen Leipzig and FC Berlin on 3 November 1990. The police had fired between 50 and 100 shots in one minute.[264] The hooligan scene of FC Berlin would shape the entire 1990–91 season.[265] FC Berlin continued to struggle in the second half of the league season. The team was in 12th place in the league towards the end of the season.[266] However, FC Berlin won its last two matches in the league, against Chemnitzer FC and FC Victoria 91 Frankfurt, and finished the 1990-91 NOFV-Oberliga in 11th place.[266] The team was thus qualified for the play-off for the 2. Bundesliga. FC Berlin was one point behind leaders BSV Stahl Brandeburg before the final round. The team defeated 1. FC Magdeburg 3–5 away, but BSV Stahl Brandenburg defeated 1. FC Union Berlin 0–2 away. FC Berlin thus finished in second place and just narrowly failed to qualify for the 2. Bundesliga.[267][268][257] The team lost several key-players after the season, such as Heiko Bonan, Burkhard Reich, Waldemar Ksienzyk, Thorsten Boer, Eike Küttner and Hendrik Herzog.[268][269]\\n\\nDecline (1991-1994)\\nFC Berlin recruited midfielder Ralf Rambow from Eisenhüttenstädter FC Stahl for the 1991–92 season. The 1991–92 season was the first season when teams from East Germany and teams from West Germany played in the same league system. The NOFV-Oberliga was now at third tier in the league system. FC Berlin was qualified for the 1991-92 DFB-Pokal as a participant in the 1990–91 2. Bundesliga play-off. It was the club\'s first participation in the DFB-Pokal. The team was drawn against SC Freiburg. The starting eleven included players such as Oskar Kosche, Christian Backs, Jens-Uwe Zöphel, Jörg Fügner, Mario Tolkmitt and Mikhail Pronichev. FC Berlin lost the match 0–2.[270] Heiko Brestrich returned to the team during the summer of 1991.[271] Brestrich would be a key-player of FC Berlin in the 1990s. FC Berlin came to dominate the 1991-92 NOFV-Oberliga. The team lost only two matches during the entire league season and scored a total of 97 goals.[272] FC Berlin was once again qualified for the play-off for the 2. Bundesliga. The team finished the play-off in third place. Volkswagen-backed VfL Wolfsburg won the play-off, which meant that no team from the former East Germany was able to advance.[272] FC Berlin lost 11 players after the 1991–92 season, including Mario Tolkmitt, Christian Backs, Jörn Lenz, Jörg Fügner and Oskar Kosche.[273][274] In total, FC Berlin lost two complete teams in the first one or two years after the fall of the Berlin Wall.[256]\\n\\nFailing to win win promotion to the 2. Bundesliga, FC Berlin had to continue at amateur level. The main competitors in the following seasons of the NOFV-Oberliga Nord were teams such as Tennis Borussia Berlin, BSV Stahl Brandenburg and Eisenhüttenstädter FC Stahl. With the many player departures after the 1991–92 season, Jürgen Bogs once again had to build a new team.[273] FC Berlin recruited forward Bernd Jopek for 1. FC Union Berlin and midfielder Stefan Oesker from Blau-Weiß 1890 Berlin for the 1992–93 season.[273] The team was also strengthened by a number of youth players.[273] FC Berlin now had to rely on its youth department to supply the team with new players.[275] The team finished the 1992-93 NOFV-Oberliga Nord in fourth place. Dirk Rehbein and Ralf Rambow left for 1. FC Union Berlin after the season.[276][277] FC Berlin was no longer the absolute treasure trove among former East German clubs, but continued to produce talent thanks to its excellent youth work.[277] Among the players from the youth department on the squad in 1993–94 season were Jens Reckmann, Mike Jesse, Ronny Nikol, Michael Franke, Marcell Fensch and Rayk Schröder.[278][275][273][276][277] The team of FC Berlin that played against Spandauer SV on the fifth matchday on 9 September 1993 had an avagerage age of only 21,33 and was the youngest team of BFC Dynamo to have ever played a competitive match.[279] Helmut Koch replaced Jürgen Bogs as coach on 28 September 1993.[280] FC Berlin finished the 1993-94 NOFV-Oberliga Nord in fourth place and qualified for the new Regionalliga Nordost.\\n\\nRegionalliga Nordost and first Berlin cup title (1994–1999)\\nMario Kallnik returned to the club for the 1994–95 season. The re-instated Regionalliga would now form the new third tier in the German football league system. The 1994-95 Regionalliga Nordost meant new meetings with well-known opponents such as FC Carl Zeiss Jena, 1. FC Union Berlin and FC Rot-Weiß Erfurt.[281] BFC Dynamo struggled in the 1994-95 Regionalliga Nordost, but managed to retain its place in the league.[282] Jens-Uwe Zöphel left the team for FC Energie Cottbus after the season. The team was joined by goalkeeper Daniel Bartel from the youth department for the 1995–96 season. Bartel became the new first-choice goalkeeper at the beginning of the season. The highlights of the 1995-96 Regionalliga Nordost were new meetings with old rival 1. FC Dynamo Dresden.[283] The two teams had not met since the 1990–91 season.[284][281] The first meeting was played in front of 2,002 spectators at the Stadion im Sportforum on 8 September 1995. The score was 1–3 at half break.[283] The match ended 4–3 to 1. FC Dynamo Dresden.[284][281] Club President Klaus Bittroff resigned on 14 September 1995 and Vice president Volkmar Wanski became the new club president.[285] The team had a difficult start to the 1995-95 Regionalliga Nordost. Due to acute danger of relegation, coach Koch was dismissed on 17 October 1995. Werner Voigt became the new coach.[286][287] Voigt had a long background in the club as a player and coach. With Voigt, the experienced defender Mario Maek also returned to the club.[286] FC Berlin organized one of the biggest youth football tournaments so far in the eastern part of the country in the Sportforum Hohenschönhausen on 6–8 April 1996. As many as 30 youth teams from clubs such as Chelsea F.C., Everton F.C., Feyenoord, FC Bayern München and Borussia Dortmund participated.[288][287] FC Berlin found itself in the relegation zone towards the end of the 1995-95 Regionalliga Nordost.[289] The place in the league was saved with a 1–0 win over FSV Wacker 90 Nordhausen on the 33rd matchday, 19 May 1996. The winning goal was scored by Mario Maek.[283]\\n\\nExperienced players such as Heiko Brestrich, Mario Maek, and Jens Reckmann would form the team\'s backbone during the 1996–67 season.[290] FC Berlin defeated 1. FC Dynamo Dresden 2–0 in the opening match of the 1996–97 Regionalliga Nordost in front of 2,300 spectators at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark.[291] Then followed a sharp decline.[292] The team would lose 6–0 away to its other rival 1. FC Union on the ninth matchday.[293] It was the biggest loss to date against 1. FC Union Berlin.[294] Club President Wanski announced on 26 November 1996 that the financial reserves had been used up.[287] The millions of Deutsche Mark that the club had made from player transfers in the early 1990s were now gone.[295] Wanski would then support the club every year with personal contributions.[296][297] During the second half of the 1995–96 season, he became shirt sponsor with his own company Regio Bautenschutz GmbH.[290] The shirts had not had a sponsor in almost seven years.[290] FC Berlin also signed a two-year sponsoring contract with the Italian sportswear manufacturer Fila during the spring of 1996, where Fila became the club\'s equipment sponsor. The club previously had no equipment sponsor.[298] Fila had reportedly been impressed by the club\'s youth work.[298] FC Berlin finished the 1996-67 Regionaliga Nordost on 13th place after another weak season. Mikhail Pronichev left the team for TuS Makkabi Berlin and Jens Reckmann for 1. FC Dynamo Dresden after the season.\\n\\nThe team recruited Croatian defender Davor Krznarić for the 1997–98 season. The 1997-98 Regionalliga Nordost was also a struggle, with the team in 12th place in the league at the winter break.[299] The club still received New Year\'s greetings from Real Madrid and Liverpool F.C. in 1997.[300] Experienced defender Jörn Lenz returned to the club during the winter break.[301] Lenz would be a key player for several seasons to come. The successes in the Regionalliga Nordost had not materialized. It became known that coach Voigt had signed for 1. FC Dynamo Dresden for the 1998–99 season. The club and Voigt decided to part ways.[302] Assistant coach Ingo Rentzsch took over on 12 March 1998.[303] The team played an exciting 5–5 draw away against 1. FC Magdeburg away on the 33rd matchday, 5 May 1998. Bernd Jopek, Jörn Lenz, Davor Krznarić, Marek Seruga, and Mario Kallnik scored one goal each in the match.[303][304] New coach for the 1998–99 season was Henry Häusler.[305] Players central to the team in the 1998–99 season were Heiko Brestrich, Jörn Lenz, Mario Maek, Martino Gatti, Mario Kallnik, Davor Krznarić, Timo Lesch, and Sven Ohly, with Lenz as team captain.[305][306] Coach Häusler was eventually dismissed on 18 March 1999 and assistant coach Ingo Rentzsch again took over as interim coach.[307] Club President Wanski came up with the idea to revive the old name BFC Dynamo during the autumn of 1998. He said: \\\"We stand by Dynamo\'s sporting tradition, we reject the club\'s political past.\\\"[308][297] An overwhelming majority at the general meeting on 8 May 1999 voted to take back the old name.[309] The team met local rival Union Berlin on the penultimate matchday of the 1998-99 Regionalliga Nordost, 8 May 1999. The team now again competed as BFC Dynamo. Coach Rentzsch threw in the towel at half-time and left the stadium, allegedly because Club President Wanski had wanted to dictate the line-up.[310][311][312] Youth trainer Norbert Paepke took over as coach in the second half of the match.[310][313] BFC Dynamo won the derby 2–0 with two goals by Marcel Solomo in front of 2,543 spectators at the Stadion an der Alten Försterei.[314] BFC Dynamo reached the final of the 1998-99 Berlin Cup. The team defeated Berlin Türkspor 1965 with 4–1 in the final on 11 May 1999 and finally won its first Berlin Cup title. Ayhan Gezen and Mario Maek scored one goal each, and Heiko Brestrich scored two goals for BFC Dynamo in the final.[315]\\n\\nRelegation to NOFV-Oberliga and crash (1999–2001)\\nBFC Dynamo recruited goalkeeper Nico Thomaschewski for the 1999–2000 season. Thomaschewski became the new first-choice goalkeeper. Torsten Boer, Jens Reckmann and Dirk Rehbein also returned to the club.[316][317] The team was also joined by forward Marcel Riediger from the youth department. Marcel Riediger was the son of former BFC Dynamo striker Hans-Jürgen Riediger.[318][319] The team lost 0–2 to Arminia Bielefeld the first round of the 1999-2000 DFB-Pokal.[320] BFC Dynamo defeated SG Dynamo Dresden 1–0 on the sixth matchday.[316] The team stood at a sensational second place in the league after the eight matchday, but then followed a sharp descline.[321][322] BFC Dynamo suffered a period of crisis during the autumn of 1999.[323] The financial difficulties had continued. The number of sponsors was too few and the club was financially dependent on Club President Volkmar Wanski. The number of spectators also remained low and new sponsors were deterred by hooliganism.[311] The team went through several league matches without a single win. Heiko Brestrich eventually rebelled against coach Klaus Goldbach in early November 1999 and was suspended. He was then sacked and transferred to VfB Leipzig.[324][325][326][327] Brestrich was very popular with the supporters of BFC Dynamo and was popularly called \\\"Heiko Brestrich - Football God\\\" (German: Heiko Brestrich - Fußballgott).[324][328] He had played a total of 301 matches for BFC Dynamo during his career, including 282 matches between 1991 and 1999.[324][329] The team was joined by Russian striker Denis Kozlov later the same month. Kozlov would eventually prove successful at BFC Dynamo. Coach Goldbach was eventually dismissed in early December 1999 and Jürgen Bogs returned for his third stint as coach.[330]\\n\\nThe club finally got a promising main sponsor in the form of the software company Lipro AG at the beginning of 2000.[331][332] However, the difficulties in the league continued and the club\'s liabilities had already started to become significant.[332] BFC Dynamo finished the 1999-2000 Regionalliga Nordost in 17th place and was relegated to the NOFV-Oberliga Nord. For the first time in its history, BFC Dynamo was now a fourth tier team.[333] BFC Dynamo reached the final of the Berlin Cup for a second consecutive season, but lost the final of the 1999-2000 Berlin Cup 2–0 against the reserve team of Tennis Borussia Berlin.[334] Club President Wanski resigned on 29 June 2000.[335][336][337] The reason was allegedly that the sponsor Lipro AG demanded greater influence in club decision making.[335][336] The club was now temporary in the hands of Sports director Hans Reker.[335] Mario Maek retired as a player after the 1999–2000 season and several players left the team, including Thorsten Boer and Martino Gatti.[335][336] A new team was put together for the 2000-01 NOFV-Oberliga Nord. The budget for the season was 2.3 million Deutsche Mark, which set new record for the NOFV-Oberliga Nord.[336] The team was joined by striker Dirk Vollmar, Cameroonian midfielder Aka Adek Mba, Brazilian midfielder Alexandre Vieira dos Santos, nicknamed \\\"Macalé\\\", as well as five Romanian players: Dănuț Oprea, Silvian Cristescu, Aurel Panait, Dorel Zegrean, and Florin Bătrânu.[336][338] SPD-politician Karin Halsch became new club president on 27 September 2000.[339][340][nb 7] BFC Dynamo dominated the 2000-01 NOFV-Oberliga Nord. The team was drawn against arch-rival 1. FC Union Berlin in the quarter-finals of the 2000-01 Berlin Cup The match was played in front of 4,427 spectators at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark on 24 March 2001. BFC Dynamo lost 3–0.[341] Serious riots broke out after the match when BFC Dynamo supporters clashed with the police.[342] The team finished the 2000-01 NOFV-Oberliga in first place, with only three losses in 34 matches.[343] Denis Kozlov had scored a wopping 29 goals for BFC Dynamo in the league.[343] The team would now face 1. FC Magdeburg in a play-off for promotion to the Regionalliga Nord.\\n\\nHowever, it had become apparent that the club had serious financial problems two weeks before the play-offs. Players and coaches had received their January salaries in March and had not received any salaries since. The club was also behind with insurance payments.[344][345][346] The German Football Association (DFB) demanded that the club could provide a bank guarantee of 4.2 million Deutsche Mark to secure the budget for the possible 2001–02 Regionalliga Nord. It was already clear before the first match in the play-offs that the club would have difficulty meeting the requirements of the DFB in the event of promotion.[343][347] The first match of the play-offs ended 0–0 in front of 8,282 spectators at the Stadion im Sportforum on 2 June 2001.[348] The second match was played at the Ernst-Grube-Stadion in Magdeburg on 9 June 2001. Around 2,000 supporters from BFC Dynamo traveled to the second match.[349][350] The score was 2–2 at half time. BFC Dynamo was practically promoted at this point.[348] However, the team ultimately lost the match 2–5.[348][351] The club\'s debts were now estimated at 1.5 million Deutsche Mark.[352] And now, also the main sponsor Lipro AG was in financial trouble.[353][354] Several players left the club directly after the 2000–01 season, including Marcel Riediger and Denis Kozlov.[343][352]\\n\\nInsolvency (2001–2002)\\nInsurance company AOK filed for insolvency against BFC Dynamo on 21 June 2001. The company demanded 126,000 Deutsche Mark in unpaid insurance payments.[355] Club President Karin Halsch resigned on 25 June 2001.[355] There had been major discrepancies between Halsch and sports director Hans Reker regarding how the situation should be resolved.[355] Reker took over as acting president.[356] Supporters of BFC Dynamo started the fundraiser \\\"Save BFC Dynamo\\\" (German: Rettet den BFC). The fundraiser quickly succeeded in raising 40,000 Euros.[357][358][359] More players left the team during the summer of 2001, including Mario Kallnik and Aka Adeck Mba.[360] The debts were estimated at 5 millions Deutsche Mark, of which 4.2 million were loans from Lipro AG and 1.3 short-term debts, at this point.[361] The club tried to initiate a partnership with FC Dynamo Moscow, in which BFC Dynamo would serve as a farm team for FC Dynamo Moscow in Europe.[362] But the plan led nowhere.[363] A preliminary insolvency administrator was appointed at the end of August 2001.[364] It was estimated that insolvency proceedings could be opened on 1 November 2001.[365] Insolvency proceedings were opened against main sponsor Lipro AG on 5 October 2001.[366]\\n\\nThe preliminary insolvency administrator estimated the club\'s debts at 6 million Deutsche Mark.[367] BFC Dynamo needed 30,000 Deutsche Mark by 31 October 2001 in order to commence insolvency proceedings.[368] However, the club did not have the money.[369] Discussions with new sponsors failed.[370] If insolvency proceedings could not be opened, the club would go bankrupt and have to restart in the Kreisliga under a new name.[363][365][371][368] Supporters organized a demonstration that marched from the Sportforum Hohenschönhausen to the Rotes Rathaus. Also former players such as Hans-Jürgen Riediger, Rainer Troppa, Waldemar Ksienzyk and Heiko Brestrich planned to participate. The demonstration was received at the Rotes Rathaus by former club president and SPD-politician Halsch.[369][372][368] A group of sponsors around former president Volkmar Waski finally came forward and offered the money required to commence insolvency proceedings.[373][374] The club\'s entire presidium resigned on 31 October 2001.[375][337] An emergency board formed by André Sommer, Rayk Bernt and press spokesman Holger Zimmermann was appointed by the club\'s Economic Council.[376][370]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo is said to have made millions on player sales after Die Wende.[356][377][378] The club was for a time considered the richest amateur club in Germany.[295] But not all the money had went to the club, some had also went to SV Dynamo, DFV and advisers.[379][380] The club\'s reputation as the former Stasi club made it difficult to win new sponsors.[296][381][356][382] The club was also plagued by hooliganism, which repeatedly caused negative headlines.[382][340] FC Berlin failed to qualify for the 2. Bundesliga and never progressed beyond the third tier of the German football league system.[383] The number of spectators was only a couple of hundred per match in the early 1990s and the income from membership fees was marginal.[382][383] The club also maintained a large youth department which at one point cost about 400,000 Deutsche Mark per year.[382] At the end of 1996, the club still had no debts, but also no money left in its bank accounts.[296] President Wanski would then have to support the club with his own financial contributions.[296] It is estimated that Wanski invested an estimated 3 million Deutsche Mark of private money in the club over the five years before his resignation.[384] BFC Dynamo finally got a promising new sponsor in the form of Lipro AG in early 2000. Millions of Deutsche Mark would now be available.[385] But the club\'s liabilites had already started to become significant.[385] The club made a bid to reach the third tier Regionalliga Nord, and sports director Hans Reker started signing new players.[385] However, the millions from sponsor Lipro AG would later turn out to be loans.[385]\\n\\nThe emergency board was considered to represent the interest of the sponsor group around Wanski.[386] André Sommer and Rayk Bernt were controversial due to their membership in the Hells Angels.[387] However, both were also long-time supporters; Sommer had been a member of the hooligan scene back in the 1980s.[388][389] Zimmermann resigned from the emergency board on 23 November 2001, as he thought Sommer and Berndt had given the club an image he could not identify with.[390] A new presidium was due to be elected at a general meeting on 26 November 2001.[337] But the general meeting was converted into an \\\"information event\\\" by a vote of 87 to 59, at the insistence of the emergency board.[390][391] Some club members felt they had been blackmailed.[391] Sommer and Bernt continued to lead the club during the opening of the insolvency proceedings, but the legitimacy of their presidium was questioned.[390]\\n\\nInsolvency proceedings were opened on 1 November 2001.[392][393][394] BFC Dynamo was thus automatically relegated to the Verbandsliga Berlin.[372] All contracts with professionals and employees were terminated.[372][395][396][393] The club now had to continue under amateur conditions, the players could only be offered 300 Euros per month.[369][337] Only three players from the original squad remained for the first mandatory friendly match, one of them was team captain Piotr Rowicki.[397][337] Jörn Lenz left for VfB Leipzig and Nico Thomaschewski for SV Babelsberg 03.[337] Coach Jürgen Bogs also decided not to continue.[374][398] Former assistant coach Mario Maek stepped in as the new coach on a voluntary basis, assisted by goalkeeping coach Bodo Rudwaleit.[398] The club once again had to rely on its youth players.[399]\\n\\nSommer and Bernt met great opposition due to their membership in the Hells Angels.[400] The duo had a deterrent effect and failed to attract new sponsors.[388][401] Supporters collected signatures to elect a new presidium.[388][402] But the signatures were ignored by Sommer and Berndt.[388][402] The former coach of the women\'s team Volkmar Lucius then took legal action for violation of the statutes.[388][402] The Sommer and Bernt presidium was then finally overthrown by supporters and Lucius, through a successful application to the Charlottenburg District Court.[388][402][401] The court appointed Lucius as an emergency board member on 30 April 2002.[388][403] Sommer and Bernt had, after all, helped make sure that the insolvency proceedings could be opened by their personal financial contributions.[402][404] But the duo would no longer have much say in the club after 2003.[405] The interest group IG BFC\'er managed to persuade entrepreneur Mike Peters to become the new club president.[401][404] Peters was elected as the new president on 31 May 2002.[406] The preferential claims of 204,000 Euros looked insurmountable.[401] But the supporters had negotiated with creditors and received numerous waivers.[401][407] They had also set up a donations account and collected at least 13,800 Euros themselves.[407][406] The new presidum around Peters would also contribute 100,000 Euros from private money to the insolvency plan.[406][401][407] Peters also committed to funding a large part of the budget for the 2002-03 Verbandsliga Berlin.[406][408]\\n\\nRestart in Verbandsliga Berlin and end of insolvency (2002–2004)\\nFormer BFC Dynamo player Dirk Vollmar became the new coach for the 2002–03 season.[406] Bodo Rudwaleit continued as assistant coach.[406] Nico Thomaschewski and Aka Adeck Mba returned for the 2002–03 season.[409][410] The team was also joined by defender Robert Rudwaleit from the reserve team.[411][408][412] Robert Rudwaleit was the son of Bodo Rudwaleit and had made his first few appearances with the first team during the previous season.[413] BFC Dynamo defeated the reserve team of 1. FC Union Berlin in both meetings in 2002-03 Verbandsliga Berlin.[414] The team eventuallty finished its first season in the Verbandsliga Berlin in third place.[414] The insolvency situation was complex. The club had about 170 creditors. It was still unclear whether the insolvency proceedings could be successful.[415]\\n\\nJörn Lenz returned to the club for the 2003–04 season.[416] BFC Dynamo also recruited striker Danny Kukulies from SC Pfullendorf for the season. Kukulies had a long background in the youth department of BFC Dynamo.[417] BFC Dynamo was in third place after the first half of the season, nine points behind BFC Preussen and six points behind second placed SV Tasmania Gropiusstadt 73.[418] The team defeated SV Tasmania Gropiusstadt 73 2–1 in the first league match after the winter break, with one goal by Lenz and one goal by Robert Rudwaleit.[419] The team would also win the following matches.[420] BFC Dynamo eventually finished the 2003-04 Verbandsliga Berlin in first place and won promotion back to the NOFV-Oberliga Nord. The team had won all 17 matches in the second half of the league season, which set new record in the Verbandsliga Berlin.[421] Danny Kukulies scored 32 goals and Tomasz Suwary 22 goals in the 2003-04 Verbandsliga Berlin.[422] The insolvency proceedings would finally come to a positive conclusion after a meeting with the creditors at the Charlottenburg District Court on 8 June 8, 2004. The 192 creditors received an insolvency rate of 0.25 percent.[423][422] The insolvency proceedings were then finally declared closed by the Charlottenburg District Court on 16 June 2004, after one complaint was dismissed.[424]\\n\\nConsolidation, Regionalliga Nordost and Berlin Cup success (2004-present)\\nMain article: History of Berliner FC Dynamo (2004–present)\\nConsolidation (2004-2010)\\nMario Weinkauf was elected as new club president at the annual meeting on 18 June 2004. His vision for BFC Dynamo was a club that was \\\"managed seriously from a sporting and financial perspective\\\".[425][426] Former professional player Christian Backs became the new coach for the 2004–05 season.[427] Central players in the team in the 2004–05 season were Robert Rudwaleit, Nico Thomaschewski, Dennis Kutrieb, Jörn Lenz, Danny Kukulies and Tomasz Suwary.[428][429] There were several outbreaks of riots and hooliganism among the supporters of BFC Dynamo during the season.[430][431] The club management decided not to apply for a license to the Regionalliga Nordost despite the team being in third place in the league at the start of the second half of the season. The financial consolidation was not yet complete.[432] Coach Backs left for Berliner AK 07 before the end of the season due to financial disagreements with the club.[433] BFC Dynamo finished its first season in the NOFV-Oberliga Nord since its return in sixth place.\\n\\nFormer FC Vorwärts Frankfurt player Jürgen Piepenburg took over as new coach for the 2005–06 season.[434] Jens-Uwe Zöphel also returned to the club. BFC Dynamo was debt-free ahead of the 2005–06 season.[435] BFC Dynamo negotiated a lucrative sponsorship agreement with the energy company United Sol Energy. The company\'s representative in Berlin was the Belgian former FC Bayern Munich goalkeeper Jean-Marie Pfaff.[436][435][437] The plan also included the founding of a new youth sports school at BFC Dynamo that would bear Pfaff\'s name.[437] New riots broke out among supporters in connection with the match against SV Yeşilyurt on first matchday of the 2005-06 NOFV-Oberliga Nord on 5 August 2005. As many as 13 police officers were injured in the riots.[438][439] The 2005-05 NOFV-Oberliga Nord involved new derbies against 1. FC Union Berlin. The first meeting was to be played at the Stadion an der Alten Försterei on 12 August 2005. Police carried out a controversial raid against supporters of BCF Dynamo the night before the match at the discothèque Jeton in Friedrichshain. Up to 158 people were arrested and 39 people were injured.[439][440] The players of BFC Dynamo held a vote on whether the team should play the derby or not, and decided with a narrow majority to play.[441] BFC Dynamo lost the match 8–0. Coach Piepenberg was dismissed after the match.[442]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo came to play with the logo of United Sol Energy on their shirts at the beginning of the season, despite the fact that the club had yet to receive any money.[443][444] It eventually became clear that there would be no money from United Sol Energy.[445][446] Club spokesman Yiannis Kaufmann resigned from all posts in September 2005 due to disagreements over the club\'s policy regarding sponsors. The club had received sponsorship money from companies with alleged links to Hells Angels.[447][448][449][450][451] André Sommer was considered the strong man in the background.[451] BFC Dynamo turned 40 years on 15 January 2006. The anniversary was celebrated with a party for supporters with 750 guests.[452] The club management worked to ensure that the club would no longer be associated with hooligans and the far-right scene. The Israeli fashion brand JetLag became a new sponsor at the turn of the year and Weinkauf also planned a training camp in Israel.[453] The club decided not to extend the sponsorship agreements with several controversial sponsors at the beginning of 2006. The index included companies with links to Hells Angels.[453] The return match against 1. FC Union Berlin in the 2005-06 NOFV-Oberliga Nord was played in front of 6,647 spectators at the Stadion im Sportforum on 13 May 2006.[454][455] The score was 1-1, when abound 200 supporters of BFC Dynamo invaded the pitch to storm the guest block.[456] The match was abandoned and 1.

FC Union Berlin on 13 May 2006 threw the club into a new financial crisis ahead of the 2006–07 season.[459] Potential sponsors broke off their negotiations and main sponsor JetLag terminated its agreement.[460][461][452] A significant deficit now arose in the budget.[462][463][459] The sponsor Infinity-Net Telekom GmbH made new financial commitments to fill holes in the budget at the start of the season.[462] The company\'s owner Peter Meyer became the new strong man in the club.[462][459] Meyer eventually became the club\'s savior as a sponsor.[464][465][466] However, he was also controversial at the time; Meyer had a background in the hooligan scene.[462] He was accused of having been involved in violence during a pitch invasion after the match against SV Babelsberg 03 on 14 August 2004. But Meyer had been acquitted in court.[467][468][459][469] BFC Dynamo finished the first half of the 2006-07 NOFV-Oberliga Nord in 14th place and was considered a relegation candidate.[470] Turkish-born Volkan Uluc became the new coach on 9 March 2007.[471][472] The team defeated second-placed Tennis Borussia Berlin 2–1 on the 20th matchday of the 2006-07 NOFV-Oberliga Nord.

The match ended 2–1 to BFC Dynamo, but VfB Oldenburg won the play-off on goal difference.[621][622] BFC Dynamo parted ways with coach Benbenneck after the season. The reason given was the stagnation at the end of the league season.[623] New coach for the 2022–23 season was Heiner Backhaus.[624]\\n\\nColours and crest\\nThe colours of BFC Dynamo are claret and white.[625] The colours were inherited from SC Dynamo Berlin and followed the claret colour scheme of SV Dynamo. BFC Dynamo has been playing in claret and white since the club\'s founding, with the exception of a period in the 1990s. The BFC Dynamo home kit has traditionally been a claret shirt, paired with claret or white shorts and socks. The team is occasionally nicknamed \\\"die Weinroten\\\", which means \\\"the Clarets\\\".[626][627]\\n\\nThe BFC Dynamo away kit has traditionally been a white shirt, paired with claret or white shorts and socks. However, the team used green away shirts from the end of the 1960s until the mid-1970s.[628][83] Green was the colour of the Volkspolizei, which was the official sponsor of BFC Dynamo during the East German era. The green away shirt was then exchanged for a white away shirt, paired with red or white shorts and socks.[93][99] The team used entirely red away kits during the 1981–82 and 1982–83 seasons.[629][630] The red away kit was then exchanged for a claret away kit.[631] The team again used white away shirts from the 1985–86 season.[632] The 1985–86 season also saw the instruction of a new claret and white diagonally striped away shirt.[632] The diagonally striped away shirt would be used for the rest of the 1980s.[237]\\n\\nThe club was rebranded as FC Berlin on 19 February 1990. A pure white was set as the new match colour with immediate effect.[633] FC Berlin then adopted a red and white colour scheme for the 1990–91 season.[634] In the eyes of the supporters, the red and white kit looked a lot like 1. FC Union Berlin.[634] The club played in red and white home kits for most of the FC Berlin era, but wore a black and red striped home shirt, paired with black shorts and socks from the 1996–97 season through the 1998–99 season. The club returned to its original club name on 3 May 1999 and consequently also later returned to its traditional colour scheme.[635]\\n\\n1966-1990, 1999–2009, 2023-\\n1966-1990, 1999–2009, 2023-\\n\\n \\n2009-2023\\n2009-2023\\n\\nThe crest of BFC Dynamo during the East German era featured a stylized \\\"D\\\" for SV Dynamo and the lettering \\\"BFC\\\" in red and yellow on a white background, surrounded by a yellow wreath.[636][637] BFC Dynamo abandoned its East German crest when the club was rebranded as FC Berlin on 19 February 1990.[638][639][636] The club used two different crests during the FC Berlin era. The first crest featured a stylized image of the roof of the Brandenburg Gate with the lettering \\\"FCB\\\" underneath and the club name \\\"Fussballclub Berlin\\\" in capital letters at the bottom, in white on a red background. It was only briefly used during the spring of 1990.[640] The second crest featured a stylized image of a football with the Brandenburg Gate in front, the lettering \\\"FCB\\\" at the top and the club name \\\"FC Berlin\\\" at the bottom, in red on a white background. This crest was used from the spring of 1990 until the end of the FC Berlin era.[640][284]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo reclaimed its East German crest when the club returned to its original club name on 3 May 1999.[639] But the club was no longer in possession of the crest.[639] The club had neglected to seek legal protection for its East German crest after German reunification. The neglect was likely due to managerial inexperience. Protection of trademarks was neither necessary nor common in East Germany.[636] The crest was now owned by Peter Klaus-Dieter Mager, commonly known as \\\"Pepe\\\". Pepe Mager was a famous fan of Hertha BSC and a fan merchandise dealer.[641] The club tried to recover the crest from Mager though court action, without success.[639][636] The ownership of the crest was instead passed on to Rayk Bernt and his company RA-BE Immobilien- und Handelsgesellschaft mbH.[479][642][643]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo continued to use the disputed crest on its kits and webpage. But the club would have to ask the owner of the crest every time it wanted to have a pennant made and was unable to exploit the commercial value of the crest for its own benefit.[479][516] The legal situation around the crest would also have caused problems in the event of an advance to the Regionalliga, as the German football Association (DFB) required clubs to own their crests.[517] In order establish independence, the club finally decided to adopt a new crest in 2009.[467]\\n\\nThe new crest abandoned the traditional stylized \\\"D\\\" and the lettering \\\"BFC\\\", as they would have met legal obstacles.[643] The new crest featured a black Berlin bear on claret and white stripes, together with the club name and the founding year.[643] The first version of the new crest sparked controversy. The word \\\"fußball\\\" in the club name had been written in lower case with a double \\\"s\\\" instead of the graphene \\\"ß\\\".[643] This was contrary to German spelling rules, where it is only permissible to write \\\"fußball\\\" with a double \\\"s\\\" when the word is written in upper case. Club President Norbert Uhlig ensured that there was absolutely no ulterior motive behind the spelling and claimed that the word had always been spelled like that on club pennants and scarfs.[643] The Chairman of the Economic Council Peter Meyer later claimed that the spelling was a deliberate marketing ploy, in order to have new crest immediately known across Germany.[643] A second version of the crest was soon made public, where the club name was written in upper case. The new crest was used by BFC Dynamo from the 2009–10 season.[516]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo finally managed win back the traditional crest in 2022, through the Chairman of the Economic Council Peter Meyer. Meyer had acquired the rights to the crest through one of his companies.[644] From the 2023–24 season, BFC Dynamo is once again playing with its traditional crest. The traditional crest was displayed for the first time since its reintroduction in a friendly match against Hertha BSC in front of more than 10,000 spectators at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark on 7 July 2023.[645][646]\\n\\nOwnership of the traditional crest\\nMany clubs in East Germany rushed to drop their East German names during the Peaceful revolution. BFC Dynamo was among the clubs to do so, in an attempt to distance the club from the Stasi.[639][250] The club was rebranded as FC Berlin on 19 February 1990 and consequently abandoned its East German crest.\\n\\nPepe Mager was a famous fan of Hertha BSC and fan merchandise dealer.[641] Mager had organized away trips for the fans Hertha in the early 1960s and was one of the founders of the notorious supporter group \\\"Hertha-Frösche\\\". He now sold his own fan merchandise from a mobile stand outside the Olympiastadion.[641][647][648] Mager inquired with the register of associations in Charlottenburg in 1991 about all deleted names of East German clubs.[641] He immediately found BFC Dynamo and saw business opportunities.[641][639] Mager claimed that he first secured the former crest of BFC Dynamo for 80 D-Marks in 1992.[381][643]\\n\\nThe name FC Berlin never became popular with the fans.[250] Fans continued to identify themselves with the former name and crest.[639] An overwhelming majority voted for the club to take back its original club name at the general meeting on 3 May 1999.[635] Of the 135 present, 125 voted in favor, three against and seven abstained.[309] BFC Dynamo thus reclaimed its East German crest, but the rights to the crest now belonged to Mager.[639] Mager had registered the crest in his name at the German Patent and Trademark Office on 13 May 1997.[639][649][636]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo contacted Mager for a co-operation, but an agreement could not be reached.[641][649] Mager held the opinion that the club should buy its merchandise from him, or simply buy the rights to the crest.[639] He later informed the club that he had received interest from foreign buyers and offered the club to buy the rights.[649] He claimed that the crest was worth 200,000 D-Marks.[639] BFC Dynamo on the other hand claimed that the crest should legally belong to the club. The club sued Mager in court on 20 November 2000, but eventually lost the case.[639][636] The club decided to suspend the legal dispute with Mager in the summer of 2001 and instead wanted to find a solution outside court.[650] Mager was repeatedly exposed to minor threats from the environment around BFC Dynamo and eventually sold the crest to Rayk Bernt and his company RA-BE Immobilien- und Handelsgesellschaft mbH for a price of 50,000 D-Marks in June 2002.[479][642][517][651]\\n\\nBernt was a close associate of André Sommer.[652] Bernt and Sommer had assisted the club at the opening of the insolvency proceedings in 2001–2002.[652][453][479] Both were long time fans of BFC Dynamo.[653][479][642] But the duo was controversial for their connections to Hells Angels.[653][652] Bernt and Sommer were almost as restrictive towards the club when it came to the crest as Mager had been. Bernt organized the production of fan merchandise in his own regime.[642] The club would have to ask his company every time it wanted to have a pennant made.[479] Bernt and Sommer usually agreed, manufactured the pennant and then sold it at their own fan merchandise stand at the stadium.[479] BFC Dynamo continued to use the crest and would at times be given ten percent of the revenues from their sales.[453][479][642][643] The club eventually offered 5,000 Euros for the crest, but was turned down.[453] Sponsor Peter Meyer was also said to have offered 150,000 euros for the buyback.[478] Bernt demanded a seven-digit sum, according to former Club President Mario Weinkauf.[453] The lawyer representing RA-BE Immobilien- und Handelsgesellschaft mbH allegedly claimed the crest was worth around 600,000 Euros at the time.[654]\\n\\nPresident Weinkauf planned to recover the rights to the former crest with the help of Thomas Thiel and the company Treasure AG before the general meeting on 23 June 2007. Thiel was a co-owner of Treasure AG, which was intended as a new major sponsor.[479] Bernt sold parts of the rights to the former crest to Thiel.[655] The price was allegedly a six-digit sum.[479][643] According to the plan, the club would be given the rights of use to the crest. The profits would thus go to the club. The club would pay a symbolic sum of 1 Euro per month for the rights of use. BFC Dynamo would then have a right of first refusal after the ten-year contract had expired and thus have the opportunity to eventually acquire ownership of the crest.[479][656] However, Weinkauf was ultimately rejected by club members in a vote of no-confidence at the general meeting on 23 June 2007.[485] Weinkauf would then be contacted by the former president of Tennis Borussia Berlin Peter Antony. Treasure AG became a sponsor of Tennis Borussia Berlin instead and Weinkauf would later become president of the club.[480]\\n\\nThiel sold his rights to the crest back to Bernt and his company BFC Dynamo Vermarktungsgesellschaft m.b.H in 2009.[657] The rights to the old crest where subsequently controlled again by the company RA-BE Immobilien- und Handelsgesellschaft mbH.[658][659] The company is controlled by Bernt, who sold occasional items with the former crest at his own webpage.[638] However, RA-BE Immobilien- und Handelsgesellschaft mbH transferred its rights to company AXXON AG in 2022.[660][661] In connection with the club\'s 57th anniversary in 2023, the Chairman of the Economic Council Peter Meyer revealed in an exclusive interview with Berliner Kurier that he had acquired the rights to the crest for the club through one of his companies. After more than 13 years, the traditional crest was finally back with the club. According to Berliner Kurier and Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk (MDR), a six-digit sum is said to have become due.[644][662]\\n\\nChampionship star\\nThe German Football League (DFL) introduced a system of championship stars in the 2004–05 season. The system was meant to honor the most successful teams in the Bundesliga by allowing teams to display stars on their shirts for the championships they have won. The system awarded one star for three titles, two stars for five titles, and three stars for ten titles.[663] However, the system only counted titles won in the Bundesliga since the 1963–64 season.[664][665][666]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo submitted an application to the DFL and the DFB on 9 August 2004 to receive three stars for its ten titles in the DDR-Oberliga. The club asked for equal rights and argued that the German Football Association (DFB) had absorbed the German Football Association of the GDR (DFV) with all its statistics, international matches and goal scorers.[663][667][668][664] BFC Dynamo received support from Dynamo Dresden and 1. FC Magdeburg in its attempts to achieve recognition for East German titles.[667][664]\\n\\nThe DFL responded that it was not the responsible body, but the DFB remained silent for a long time.[665] The DFB eventually declared itself responsible and recommended BFC Dynamo to submit a formal application for a new title symbol in accordance with a relevant paragraph.[664][665] BFC Dynamo commissioned a law firm in Mitte in January 2005 and sent a new letter to the DFB. The DFB announced that the application from BFC Dynamo was going to be negotiated in a meeting with the DFB presidium.[665] The meeting with the DFB presidium on 18 March 2005 agreed that all titles won in East Germany, as well all others titles won in Germany since the first recognized championship in 1903, should qualify for stars.[669] However, the decision was subject to approval by the DFL.[670] No final decision had yet been made by the DFB presidium.[671][672][673][674]\\n\\n\\nBFC Dynamo is allowed to wear one star inscribed with the number ten for its ten East German championships.\\nHowever, BFC Dynamo took matters in its own hands and unilaterally emblazoned its shirts with three stars.[672] The team displayed the three stars for first time in the match against FC Energie Cottbus II on 25 March 2005.[672] The claim by BFC Dynamo was controversial because the club had been the favorite club of Erich Mielke and had had a connection to the Stasi during the East German era.[672][673][675][676][666] Critics in the DFB environment pointed to politically influenced championships in East Germany. BFC Dynamo had been sponsored by the Stasi and had enjoyed advantages.[665] The club had privileged access to talents and a permanent training camp at Uckley in Königs Wusterhausen. However, also other clubs in East Germany had enjoyed similar advantages, which put the DFB in a difficult situation.[665] Also former East German referee and CDU parliamentarian Bernd Heynemann spoke out for recognition of all East German titles.[666]\\n\\nThe DFL rejected the application from the DFB and recommended the DFB to only honor clubs that were champions in the Bundesliga.[677] However, the DFB chose to not follow the recommendation. The DFB presidium instead decided on a compromise solution on 19 July 2005 and adopted a new regulation for the 2005–06 season which gave all clubs the right to wear one single star for the championships they have won in the former East Germany and in Germany since 1903. Clubs were also allowed to indicate the number of championships they have won in the center of the star.[678][679][680] The regulation only applies to clubs playing in a league under the DFB umbrella. It does not apply to clubs playing in the 2. Bundesliga and Bundesliga, which are organized by the DFL.[679]\\n\\nThe new regulation meant that BFC Dynamo was finally allowed to emblazon its shirts with a championship star. The regulation also affected other former East German teams including Dynamo Dresden with its eight titles, 1. FC Frankfurt with its six titles and Magdeburg with its three titles in the Oberliga.[665][680] BFC Dynamo has since then used the championship star in accordance with DFB graphic standards, displaying a star inscribed with the number ten for its ten East German titles.[681]\\n\\nStadiums\\nMain article: Stadion im Sportforum\\nThe long-time home and training facility of BFC Dynamo is the Sportforum Hohenschönhausen in Alt-Hohenschönhausen in Berlin. The sports complex is the location of the club offices and the clubhouse.[637] It is also the base of the youth teams.[637] More than 20 youth teams of BFC Dynamo regularly train at the facilities.[682] The Sportforum Hohenschönhausen is considered the spiritual home of the club.[637]\\n\\nThe Sportforum Hohenschönhausen was known as the Dynamo-Sportforum during the East German era.[683] The sports complex was built as a training center for elite sport and was home to sports club SC Dynamo Berlin, with its many departments and squads.[684][685] Development began in 1954 and expansion continued into the 1980s.[686] The Sportforum is still unique as of today.[687] The sports complex covers an area of 45 to 50 hectares and comprises 35 sports facilities as of 2020.[684][687][688][689]\\n\\n\\nA match between SC Dynamo Berlin and SC Turbine Erfurt at the Walter-Ulbricht-Stadion in 1959.\\nSC Dynamo Berlin played its first season at the large Walter-Ulbricht-Stadion in Mitte.[17][690] The team moved its home matches to the football stadium in the Dynamo-Sportforum for the short transitional 1955 season.[691] SC Dynamo Berlin returned to the Walter-Ulbricht-Stadion for the 1956 season.[690] The team would play at the Walter-Ublricht-Stadion for the rest of the 1950s.[690]\\n\\nSC Dynamo Berlin eventually moved its home matches permanentely to the Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum after the construction of the Berlin wall began on 13 August 1961.[17][692] The football stadium in the Dynamo-Sportforum held a capacity of 10,000 spectators at the beginning of the 1961–62 season.[683][nb 8] The team drew average attendances between 3,000 and 6,000 spectators in the DDR-Oberliga at the Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum in the 1960s.[704][705] The highlights were matches against local rival ASK Vorwärts Berlin and the various top teams during the period. The capacity of the football stadium in the Dynamo-Sportforum was gradually expanded during the 1960s.[692][nb 9]\\n\\n\\nA match between BFC Dynamo and BSG Chemie Leipzig at the Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum in 1966.\\nBFC Dynamo began playing occasional matches that required floodlights at the larger Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark in Prenzlauer Berg from November 1968.[692] The Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark was the home ground of FC Vorwärts Berlin at the time. However, the stadium became vacant when FC Vorwärts Berlin was relocated to Frankfurt an der Oder on 31 July 1971.[63] BFC Dynamo played its home matches in the 1971-72 European Cup Winners\' Cup at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark.[708] The matches against Åtvidabergs FF in the quarter-finals on 22 March 1972 and FC Dynamo Moscow in the semi-finals on 5 April 1972 were each attended by 30,000 spectators.[709][710] The team also played two home matches in the 1971-72 DDR-Oberliga at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark.[711] However, more matches at the stadium were not possible after the summer of 1972, as the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark was then undergoing extensive renovation for the upcoming 10th World Festival of Youth and Students.[690]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo was qualified for the 1972-73 UEFA Cup. However, neither the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark nor the Walter-Ulbricht-Stadion were available for the upcoming UEFA Cup matches. Both were undergoing extensive renovation for the 10th World Festival of Youth and Students. Instead, the Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum underwent a complete transformation in just five weeks between the end of July 1972 and September 1972.[690] The capacity of the Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum was now expanded to 20,000 spectators.[712][713][692] BFC Dynamo played all home matches in the 1972-73 UEFA Cup at the Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum. The attendance of 20,000 spectators during the match against Liverpool on 29 November 1972 is still a record attendance for the stadium.[696] BFC Dynamo remained at the Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum for a couple more seasons. The team saw rising attendance numbers at the Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum during the 1970s.[714] An average of 12,000 people attended the last six matches of BFC Dynamo at the Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum in the second half of the 1973–74 season.[692] The match between BFC Dynamo and 1. FC Magdeburg in the 1974-75 DDR-Oberliga at the Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum on 8 March 1975 was attended by a whole 19,000 spectators.[715]\\n\\n\\nA match between BFC Dynamo and SG Dynamo Dresden in front of 25,000 spectators at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark in 1976.[716]\\nBFC Dynamo eventually moved its home matches to the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark for the 1975–76 season, due to upcoming repair work at the Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum.[692] The move was meant to be temporary, but eventually became permanent.[692] The Dynamo-Sportforum would primarily serve as a training facility from then and the football stadium would be used mostly by the reserve team BFC Dynamo II. The Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark held a capacity of 30,00 spectators in the 1975–76 season.[708] The average home attendance of 16,538 spectators for BFC Dynamo at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Stadion in the 1975-76 DDR-Oberliga is the highest average league attendance in club history.[17][717] BFC Dynamo celebrated nine of its ten DDR-Oberliga titles in the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Stadium. The team also played most of its home matches in the UEFA competitions at the stadium. BFC Dynamo hosted teams such as Shakhtar Donetsk, Red Star Belgrade, Nottingham Forest, Hamburger SV, Aston Villa, AS Roma FC Aberdeen at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Stadium in the 1970s and 1980. However, all matches in the derby against 1. FC Union Berlin were played at the neutral Stadion der Weltjugend from the 1976–77 season for security reasons.[294][718][719][720]\\n\\nA permanent training camp for BFC Dynamo was built in Uckley in the Zernsdorf district of Königs Wusterhausen in Bezirk Potsdam at the end of the 1960s.[721] It was located in the woods and completely sealed off from the surroundings.[721][722] The training camp covered an area of around 10 hectares.[722] The complex was equipped with a boarding school, several football pitches, a sports hall, a swimming pool, a fitness area and a sauna.[723][724][725][722][726] The team would gather in Uckley days before its European matches.[17] The players would have access to catering facilities, a nearby lake, a bowling alley, a cinema and pinball machines, among other things.[725][726]\\n\\n\\nThe team of BFC Dynamo in front of the new grandstand of the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark in 1987.\\nBFC Dynamo moved its home matches temporary to the Dynamo-Sportforum for the 1986–87 season, as the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark was undrgoing redevelopment during the season for the upcoming 750th anniversary of Berlin.[692][708] The team also played its home matches in the 1986-87 European Cup at the Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum. The team then returned to the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark for the 1987–88 season.[727] The Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark now had a new four storey grandstand and new floodlight masts. The current grandstand and the floodlights of the stadium dates from this time.[696] The club was rebranded as FC Berlin after Die Wende. FC Berlin moved permanently to the Stadion im Sportforum at the beginning of the 1992–93 season.[696] The team would remain in the Sportforum Hohenschönhausen for many seasons to come.[692]\\n\\nThe capacity of the Stadion im Sportforum had been reduced to about 12,000 spectators by 1992.[692] FC Berlin only drew an average of a couple of hundred spectators per match at the Stadion im Sportforum in the mid-1990s. The highlights were the matches against 1. FC Union Berlin. FC Berlin under Club President Volkmar Wanski announced plans in April 1998 to buy and modernize the stadium.[300] However, the plans eventually failed due to lack of funds. The team saw rising attendance numbers at the Stadion im Sportforum at the end of the 1990s.[714] Active supporters of BFC Dynamo were traditionally found at the northern curved end, popularly known as the Nordwall stand.[717] 4,220 spectators watched the match between BFC Dynamo and Union Berlin at the Stadion im Sportforum on 23 November 1999.[728]\\n\\nSupporters of BFC Dynamo installed new bucket seats on the main stand and built a new clubhouse next to the main stand of the Stadion im Sportforum in 2002–2003.[729] The Stadion im Sportforum was then equipped with a 25-metre player tunnel and plexiglass-clad coaching benches in November 2004.[730] BFC Dynamo made new plans for a modern football stadium in the Sportforum Hohenschönhausen in 2006 under Club President Mario Weinkauf. The club now wanted to build a new modern stadium for 10,000–15,000 spectators.[731] However, these plans did not materialize either. The Stadion im Sportforum was closed at the end of the 2005–06 season following the riots during the match between BFC Dynamo and Union Berlin on 13 May 2006.[457] BFC Dynamo temporarily had to move to the Friedrich-Ludwg-Jahn-Sportpark.[461] The stadium was then refurbished in 2006–2007 to increase safety and meet the requirements of the NOFV.[487] The refurbishment included a new fence.[732]\\n\\n\\nA match between BFC Dynamo and SV Babelsberg 03 on 23 April 2017.\\nBFC Dynamo won promotion to the Regionalliga Nordost at the end of the 2013–14 season. The team moved permanently to the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark for the 2014–15 season, due to increased media and spectator interest following its promotion.[696][733] The 2014-15 Regionalliga Nordost meant matches against well-known opponents such as 1. FC Magdeburg and FC Carl Zeiss Jena. The more central location of the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark was seen by the club as an opportunity to attract more spectators.[733] The match between BFC Dynamo and 1. FC Magdeburg on 8 November 2014 was attended by 5,103 spectators.[734] Active supporters of BFC Dynamo have traditionally been found on the main stand, and on the side opposite the main stand (German: die Gegengerade) of the Friedrich Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark.[717] The match between BFC Dynamo and FC Schalke 04 in the first round of the 2018-19 DFB-Pokal at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark on 17 August 2017 was watched by 14,117 spectators.[570] The attendance was the highest attendance for BFC Dynamo since the fall of the Berlin wall.[570][86] The average league attendance of BFC Dynamo in the 2017-18 Regionalliga Nordost would also be the highest average league attendance of BFC Dynamo since the 1990-91 season.[705]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo had to play a number of matches at the Stadion im Sportforum at the end of the 2018–19 season due to safety issues relating to the dilapidated floodlights at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark.[735] The move was greeted by some supporters as a move to the true home of the club.[736] The club was then set to return to the Sportforum in the 2020–21 season as the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark was planned to be demolished for a complete redevelopment.[637] The team was allowed to continue play in the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark until 31 December 2020.[737] BFC Dynamo then officially announced on 21 March 2021 that the club was going to move back to the Sportforum Hohenschönhausen for the next season.[738]\\n\\nThe Stadion im Sportforum was equipped with a floodlight system in April 2021.[739][740] The club organized a work effort in the summer of 2021 to get the stadium in shape for the upcoming Regionalliga season. [741] Supporters of BFC Dynamo gathered and cleared sections of the old stadium from weeds.[742] Members of the interest group IG BFC\'er also restored the iconic manual scoreboard above the curved end towards the Weißenseer Weg in time for the first home match of the 2021–22 season against Energie Cottbus on 28 July 2021.[743] The attendance for BFC Dynamo at the Stadion im Sportforum in the 2021-22 Regionalliga Nordost was almost tripled compared to the last comparable league season before the COVID-19 pandemic. 3,219 people watched the match between BFC Dynamo and FC Carl Zeiss Jena on 10 April 2022.[744]\\n\\nFuture stadium\\nThe large stadium in the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark is planned to be demolished towards the end of 2023 for a complete redevelopment.[745] The new stadium im the Fredrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark is designed as an inclusive sports facility. The stadium will hold 20,000 spectators and meet the requirements for play in the 3. Liga and 2. Bundesliga.[746][747][745] BFC Dynamo will be able to play matches at the new stadium. The new stadium in the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark is planned to be opened in 2028.[748]\\n\\nSupporters\\nEast German era\\nBFC Dynamo played only a minor role in football in Berlin until the relocation of FC Vorwärts Berlin to Frankfurt an der Oder in 1971.[717] The club initially had modest support, but with its growing successes in the 1970s, the club began to attract young fans, primarily from the central areas around the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark, such as Prenzlauer Berg and Mitte.[174] Many came from working class families in Prenzlauer Berg.[749] One of the first big supporter groups of BFC Dynamo was Black Eagle. The fan club was founded in 1972 and was one of the earliest fan clubs in East German football. Fans of BFC Dynamo were the first to sew their embroidered fan club badges on their jackets. This was a novelty among football supporters in East Germany in the 1970s.[750]\\n\\nThe supporter scene became a focal point for various subcultures in the late 1970s and beginning of the 1980s.[751][520][752] There were punks, rockers, hippies and a few early skinheads.[751][717][753][754][137] Some were left-leaning and others were right-leaning.[751][754] Football and stadium life offered free spaces that were difficult for the authorities to control.[137] For some fans, being part of the supporter scene was an opportunity to rebel against the East German regime.[751] Most supporters of BFC Dynamo had little to do with the state. It was more important for them to protest, do their own thing and break out from everyday life.[717] Despite cheering for a club associated with the Stasi, supporters of BFC Dynamo were not loyal to the line.[751] Many active fans of BFC Dynamo in the 1980s were against the regime.[177][754] Some supporters would even cut out the \\\"D\\\" for SV Dynamo from their club patches. They considered the \\\"BFC\\\" to be free from the Stasi, while they thought the \\\"D\\\" symbolized the exact opposite.[755]\\n\\n\\\"We provoked with chants and slogans. We were right, left, punk, hippie, skinhead. We were direct and provocative, kind and evil, in love, or drunk. Cool words were always well received. Right or left, I don\'t want to classify one. We were all in our fan group against the GDR, rebellion!\\\"\\n\\n– A fan of BFC Dynamo in the 1980s[756]\\nYoung people were gradually attracted by the provocative image of the club: its successes, its reputation as a Stasi club and the hatred of opposing fans.[520][752] Some fans of BFC Dynamo found delight in the unpopularity of their club and took pride in the hatred they met.[754][757][32] One fan recalled that the 1980s \\\"were my greatest years, as we always had glorious success in provoking other fans\\\" and another one that \\\"we were really hated by everyone\\\".[757] Fans of BFC Dynamo would sometimes respond to the hatred they met by singing chants in praise of Erich Mielke as a provocation.[758] They would also throw tropical fruits, that were only available in East Berlin, at home fans during away matches in Saxony.[178][753]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo came to be associated with areas such as Prenzlauer Berg, Pankow, Weißensee, Hohenschönhausen and certain cafés and restaurants in vicinity of Alexanderplatz.[759][760] The supporter scene included groups such as Black Eagle, Norbert Trieloff, Bobbys, Iron Fist, Beatles BFC Club, Die Ratten, Berliner Wölfe, Heavy Horses, Black Pahnter and Madness boys of Preussen in the 1980s.[761] Fashion played a big role in the BFC Dynamo supporter scene.[32][754] Football supporters in East Berlin shared a sense of superiority over their counterparts in the regional districts.[760][751] This was also the case with the supporters of Union Berlin, but notably with the supporters of BFC Dynamo.[760][762][177][763]\\n\\nFootball-related violence spread in East Germany in the 1970s.[137][764] The supporter scene of BFC Dynamo was still young at the time, while clubs such Union Berlin and BSG Chemie Leipzig had large followings.[32] A trip to Leipzig or Dresden was a difficult task.[717] Supporters of BFC Dynamo responded to the hostile environment, and learned to compensate their smaller numbers, by being more aggressive and better organized.[765][174][32][766] The dislike against BFC Dynamo in stadiums around the country and the hatred of opposing fans welded its supporters together.[767] One fan of BFC Dynamo said: \\\"This feeling of being hated is what makes it so appealing.\\\" A saying among the supporters of BFC Dynamo was: \\\"We are few, but we are awesome!\\\" (German: Wir sind wenig, wir sind geil!)[768][32] One fan of BFC Dynamo recalled: \\\"It was really rumbling at away trips, and only then you felt your own strength. When we went with 200 people against 1,000 Unioners and you noticed: If you stick together, you have an incredible amount of violence.\\\"[769] Supporters of BFC Dynamo would eventually gain a reputation for being particularly violent and organized.[174] One fan of Union Berlin recalled: \\\"There was hardly an enemy mob against us, we were just too many... But the people who stood in the way of the violence-seeking BFC:ers were very few... The BFC:ers were completely organized. These hundred and fifty people, everyone knew each other. They stood as a block like a wall.\\\"[770] The book \\\"Riot Boys!\\\" by Jochen Schramm depicts the supporter scene of BFC Dynamo and contains stories of violent away trips in the early 1980s. Jochen \\\"Ellis\\\" Schramm was a member of the hooligan scene of BFC Dynamo in the 1980s.[771]\\n\\nThe development in the supporter scene of BFC Dynamo would eventually catch the attention of the authorities. The Stasi conducted a study on the violent structures of the supporter scene at the beginning of the 1980s. It found that 80 percent of those committing violent acts were 16–25 years old. Most of them were workers or students.[760] It also found that 20 percent came from families of the socialist intelligentia.[177][760] The Stasi assigned a group of two full-time officers from the district administration to the supporter scene during 1982–83 season.[772] From then, supporters of BFC Dynamo were accompanied, observed and documented.[773] This was a measure that had previously also been applied to the supporter scene of Union Berlin.[178] The authorities had allegedly been particularly alarmed when supporters of BFC Dynamo unfurled a poster in memory of Lutz Eigendorf with the text \\\"Iron Foot, we mourn you!\\\" during a match at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark in April 1983.[774][773][174] Supporters had also started a fan club in honour of Eigendorf.[753] The Stasi would try to control the supporter scene with a broad catalogue of measures: persistent talks, intimidation attempts, reporting requirements and arrests.[717][751] It would also attempt to infiltrate the fan clubs by unofficial collaborators (IM).[772] All football fan clubs in East Germany had to undergo registration.[137] According to Stasi information, BFC Dynamo had six registered fan clubs and 22 unauthorized fan clubs in 1986. Unauthorized fan clubs were those that were unregistered or did not meet DFV guidelines.[775] East German state television always tryied to hide riots from viewers. But the sound recording from football matches was the biggest problem. Additional sound systems were integrated into the stadium of BFC Dynamo for radio and television broadcasts. The system was also supposed to drown out shouts and chanting from the violent structures, so that television viewers and radio listeners would not hear anything.[776]\\n\\nThe supporter scene of BFC Dynamo came to be increasingly associated with skinheads and far-right tendencies from the mid-1980s.[174] More and more supporters of BFC Dynamo began to embrace skinhead fashion in the early 1980s.[751][717] Skinhead fashion was now considered the most provocative outfit.[751] By the mid-1980s, the club had become one of the most popular football clubs in the growing skinhead movement.[32][nb 10] The reputation of BFC Dynamo as the hated Stasi club also attracted skinheads, who used the club as a stage for their provocations.[520] Right-wing slogans and fascist chants were considered as the most challenging provocations, as anti-fascism was state doctrine and Nazism officially did not exist in East Germany.[783][137][174][751][784][637] For young people, being a Nazi was sometimes considered the sharpest form of opposition.[785] However, instances of Nazi provocations did not necessarily reflect genuine political convictions. At least some part of the \\\"drift to the right\\\" among East German youth during the 1980s was rooted in a desire to position oneself wherever the state was not.[786] One fan of BFC Dynamo said: \\\"None of us really knew anything about politics. But to raise your arm in front of the Volkspolizei was a real kick. You did that and for some of them, their whole world just fell apart\\\".[787][717][174][nb 11]\\n\\nThe first East German hooligan group developed from the supporter scene of BFC Dynamo in the 1980s. The development was partly a response to the increasing state repression against the supporter scene, notably from the Stasi.[190] An organized hooligan scene with groups, structures and training rooms, that was unique in East Germany, would eventually emerge at BFC Dynamo.[766] The hooligans of BFC Dynamo initially reacted with restraint to police intervention in the fan block. There was a risk of going to jail. However, the Volkspolizei were sometimes ruthless, especially at away matches. Towards the end of the 1980s, there was an uprising and the hooligans of BFC Dynamo now began to confront the police with violence.[794] The final of the 1987-88 FDGB-Pokal between BFC Dynamo and Carl Zeiss Jena on 4 June 1988 saw some of the most serious violence ever witnessed at an East German football match.[4] A group of 100 to 150 skinheads and other hooligans marched through Pankow to the Stadion der Weltjugend for the match. They chanted fascist slogans and clashed with other supporters.[795][779] Riots then broke out in one of the blocks shortly before the end of the match. Supporters destroyed fences and threw seats at match stewards.[796] A group of 300 supporters of BFC Dynamo attempted to invade the pitch during the victory ceremony. They caused extensive damage to 60 seating benches.[786] About a year later, supporters of BFC Dynamo would also destroy large parts of a block of the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark, during the match against AS Monaco in the 1989–90 European Cup Winners\' Cup on 1 November 1989.[797][798][nb 12]\\n\\nGerman reunification\\nA wave of violence swept through the football stadiums of East Germany in 1990.[178] The collapse of the East German regime resulted in a security vacuum.[800][801][802] The Volkspolizei was overwhelmed by the amount of disorder and often reluctant to use enough force, due to the political situation.[803][178][804][264]\\n\\n\\nSupporters of FC Berlin during the away match against FC Carl Zeiss Jena on 8 April 1990.\\nMasked supporters of FC Berlin rioted in central Jena before the away match against FC Carl Zeiss Jena in the 1989-90 DDR-Oberliga on 8 April 1990. They broke shop windows, smashed windscreens of police vehicles with stones and left a trail of destruction in the city center. Supporters of FC Berlin also fired flares at police officers during the match.[805] The disorder at the stadium would not cease and the match was eventually interrupted.[32] The riots in Jena caught rare attention by East German state media, which until then had been generally silent about football related disorder.[32][751]\\n\\n\\nA flare thrown on the pitch during the match between FC Carl Zeiss Jena and FC Berlin on 8 April 1990.\\nThere were now riots now after every home match in FC Berlin. After the last home match in the 1989-90 NOFV-Oberliga against BSG Wismut Aue on 26 May 1990, a group of 300 supporters of FC Berlin marched from Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark towards Alexanderplatz. Windows were smashed, cars were damaged and a minibus was overturned as they made their way. Supporters met at the Marx-Engels-Forum. A group of 200 people then formed a human swastika in front of the Volkspolizei. There were 21 arrests, and the police seized knives, knuckle dusters and pepper spray.[806]\\n\\nHooligans who had left East Germany for various reasons in recent years rejoined the hooligan scene after the opening of the Berlin Wall.[265][807] Some were former skinheads who had been deported by the Stasi to West Germany in the late 1980s. Now they chanted things such as \\\"Who should be our Führer? Erich Mielke!\\\" as a provocative fun, to the dismay of the club.[265][804] Supporters who returned from West Germany also brought back a new fashion based on designer clothing labels and expensive sportswear, which was adopted by the supporter scene.[265][767] While combat boots and bomber jackets were now common at many places in East Germany, some supporters of BFC Dynamo wanted to differentiate themselves. Expensive sneakers was now the new fashion in the supporter scene.[717][807][808] Brands such as Diesel, Iceberg, Chevignon, Adidas, Best Company, New Balance and Ray Ban became popular.[767][265][808][760]\\n\\nThe reputation of the hooligans of FC Berlin attracted a large number of new young people who joined the hooligan scene.[265] A series of violence occurred in connection with the cup match between Union Berlin and FC Berlin in the Second round of the 1990-91 FDGB-Pokal on 23 September 1990. Hooligans of FC Berlin stormed the home stands of the Stadion an der Alten Försterei armed with clubs and flares and hunted down supporters of Union Berlin.[263][809] Riots broke out after match. Aound 250 hooligans threw gravel and other objects at the police. At least 14 police officers were injured in the clashes.[810] Serious riots then continued in the city, involving hundreds of supporters. Street battles broke out in areas of East Berlin, even spreading to Kreuzberg in West Berlin.[811] One supporter of FC Berlin said: \\\"In 1990, thanks to the many departures to the West, it became clear relatively quickly that there was no flowerpot to be won with the current team. We then turned our attention to other things.\\\"[812]\\n\\nHooligans in East Germany unleashed almost unbridled violence against the representatives of the disintegrating East German state.[802] Violent riots had occurred in Rostock, Dresden, Erfurt and East Berlin.[802] Police had been forced to shoot warning shots during violent riots in Leipzig and one match in the 1990-91 NOFV-Oberliga had already been abandoned due to riots in the stadium.[803][813][814][815][nb 13] The situation peaked during a match between FC Sachsen Leipzig and FC Berlin on 3 November 1990. Supporters of FC Berlin travelled in large numbers to Leipzig for the match.[802] The police had only 219 officers available for the match.[264] There were clashes at the Leipzig main railway station, with one police officer injured and 50 supporters taken into custody.[264][816] A first group of around 100 supporters of FC Berlin entered the Georg-Schwarz-Sportpark in time for kick-off.[802] They were joined by a hooligans of 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig, who had forced their way into the stadium.[817][818][819][777] Supporters of both camps tried to attack each other in the stadium and the police had difficulties in maintaining a buffer zone.[264] A second group of up to 400 supporters of FC Berlin arrived later at the nearby Leipzig-Leutzsch S-Bahn station at Am Ritterschlößchen street.[802][264] Fireworks were fired as they made their way to the stadium.[820] The group was blocked from entering the stadium by police equipped with helmets and shields, despite showing valid tickets.[821][822][265] The supporters were not given any reason.[820] They were then pushed back by the police using tear gas and truncheons.[802][264][821] The group returned to the S-Bahn station and made an attempt to reach the stadium from the Pettenkofer Straße instead.[802] They were again blocked by police who immediately used truncheons.[802][820]\\n\\nRiots broke out at the S-Bahn station.[802] The station building was vandalized and numerous cars were smashed or burned, including at least one W 50 police truck and one police car.[802][264][820][816] The police was allegedly outnumbered.[823][nb 14] Cobblestones were thrown at the police waiting at the Pettenkofer Straße.[802] The police now decided to use their firearms.[802] 18-year old supporter Mike Polley (de) from the locality of Malchow in Berlin was hit by several bullets and instantly killed.[265][807] He was allegedly about to bend down to a friend when hit.[826] Several others were injured and at least another three people were seriously injured.[801][264][821] One supporter of FC Berlin was hit in the head and suffered critical injuries, but survived.[265] The police had fired between 50 and 100 shots in about a minute, from 11 different police pistols.[264][821] Reports and sources vary on what happened on the scene and how the situation was.[264] The police claim that they were surrounded.[823] But this was rebuffed by an eyewitness.[820] Shots had been fired from distances as long as 30–40 meters.[264][820] The police had also fired at fleeing supporters.[820] One supporter was hit while trying to escape into an S-Bahn train.[820] Not every injured had come with the supporters of FC Berlin. Also an uninvolved woman was shot in the leg.[264]\\n\\nAfter the shootings, some supporters of FC Berlin left the S-Bahn station by train.[823] Many were shaken, but other wanted to take revenge.[820] A group of supporters stopped a tram, kicked the driver out and maneuvered it down town.[265][802] Riots now continued in central Leipzig, where policed presence was low.[820] The riots in central Leipzig continued for several hours and the damage was extensive.[265][802][777] Supporters of FC Berlin devastated entire streets.[823] All shop windows on the Nikolaistraße opposite the main railway station were broken.[816] There was rampage at the Park Hotel.[818][824] The ground floor of a department store on Brühl was destroyed.[824] Numerous cars were demolished and up to 31 shops were smashed and looted.[824][823][264] Supporters clashed with transport police at the main railway station. New shots were fired by the police, but no one was injured.[823][265][264]\\n\\n\\nSupporters of FC Berlin commemorate Mike Polley at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark, during the match against HFC Chemie in the 1990-91 NOFV-Oberliga on 10 November 1990.\\nMike Polley was considered a beginner in the supporter scene.[823] A demonstration against police violence with 1,000 participants was arranged in Prenzlauer Berg by supporters of FC Berlin after the match against HFC Chemie on 10 November 1990.[32][264][777] The demonstration was supported by the recently founded Fanprojekt Berlin.[264] Also professional FC Berlin players such as Waldemar Ksienzyk participated in the march.[257] The demonstration received support from politicians such as Lena Schraut from the Alternative List and from left-wing activists, notably from the occupied houses near Senefelderplatz at the Schönhauser Allee.[777][265] The friendly match between East Germany and West Germany that was planned to be held on the Zentralstadion in Leipzig on 21 November 1990 was cancelled for security reasons and due to the tense situation among football supporters after the shootings.[264][777] An investigation against ten police officers was opened, but closed in April 1992.[264][777] The exact circumstances around the death of Mike Polley were never fully clarified.[822][827]\\n\\nStadium attendance collapsed in 1990. Many supporters of BFC Dynamo stopped attending matches after the Peaceful revolution, as the best players were sold off to clubs in West Germany, sports performance slumped, tickets prices rose, mass unemployment spread and hooligans had come to dominate the stands.[178][801][637][828] Some shifted their focus to ice hockey instead.[829] The average league attendance of the 1990–91 NOFV-Oberliga was by far the lowest in the league history.[801] BFC Dynamo was hit particularly hard by the decline. Average league attendance at BFC Dynamo had dropped from 8,385 in the 1988–89 season to 1,076 in the 1990–91 season.[830][831][832] Ordinary supporters had disappeared. Only young supporters remained in the stadium at FC Berlin in 1990 and 1991.[178]\\n\\nThe violent faction of FC Berlin would come to shape the entire 1990–91 season.[265] Matches involving FC Berlin were all security matches.[264] A group of 500–600 supporters of FC Berlin travelled with a special train to Rostock for an away match against F.C. Hansa Rostock on 16 March 1991.[265][833] The police did not manage to control the situation despite a record strong presence of more than 600 officers.[833][834] Riots broke out in central Rostock, where supporters smashed shops, demolished cars and attacked people.[265][767][833] Supporters without tickets stormed the Ostseestadion and there were fights with supporters of F.C. Hansa Rostock around the stadium.[833] Riots at the train station after the match had to be suppressed by the police with tear gas and water cannons.[833][265] The damage was again extensive. Up to 17 shops at the Wismarischen Straße were smashed and looted, the train station was devastated and the special train was vandalized.[834] 21 people were injured in the clashes, including nine police officers.[835][836] The damages amounted to around 750,000 Deutsche Marks.[836] The Minister President of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern Alfred Gomolka believed the Stasi was behind the riots. He claimed that the hooligans of FC Berlin were controlled by \\\"Stasi remnants\\\" who wanted to cause \\\"destabilization\\\". Also the Interior Minister of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern Georg Diederich saw the riots as a political confrontation. As a proof, they pointed to the fact that supporters of FC Berlin came with East German flags and that the club had pre-financed the special train to Rostock.[835]\\n\\nThe youth television programme Elf99 on Deutscher Fernsehfunk (DFF) ran a special story on the hooligans of FC Berlin in August 1991. The story was called \\\"Elf-Spezial: Das randalierende Rätsel – Der Berliner Hooligans zwischen Wahn und Scham?\\\" and can be found on YouTube as of 2020.[837] About 200 supporters of FC Berlin traveled to the top match against Greifswalder SC 1926 in the 1991-92 NOFV-Oberliga Nord on 3 November 1991. Repeated riots broke out during the match. Supporters of FC Berlin claim they were insulted as \\\"Stasi-pigs!\\\" by spectators in Greifswald. Supporters of FC Berlin fought with other spectators and the stadium facilities were demolished in the riots.[838] Up to 100 hooligans of FC Berlin also attacked an asylum shelter that was located right next to the stadium in Greifswald.[839][840][788][841] SV Hafen Rostock 61 subsequently postponed its upcoming league match at home against FC Berlin for security reasons.[842][841]\\n\\nHooliganism\\nThe hooligan scene of FC Berlin at the beginning of the 1990s was considered the most notorious for years in Germany. Hooligans of FC Berlin were subsequently involved in numerous fights in stadiums, woods and meadows.[178] Organized fights with other hooligan groups began in 1992 and 1993.[265] However, hooligans of FC Berlin were also involved in fights with squatters and other left-wing groups in the 1990s.[265] 25 supporters of FC Berlin fought 40 people from the left-wing scene in front of a pub on the Straße der Pariser Kommune in Friedrichshain on 17 April 1995. Several people were injured.[843] A number of people allegedly associated with the hooligan scene of FC Berlin attacked formerly occupied houses and a meeting point for left-wing football supporters at Brunnenstraße 6 and 7 in Mitte on the night of 6 September 1997. A punk concert was held on the premises at the time. Four people had to be hospitalized with injuries.[844]\\n\\nIn the years after German reunification, the club\'s eternal outside image attracted people from the underground.[752] Playing for meager crowds in regional leagues, the club eventually became a meeting place for individuals from Berlin\'s far-right, hooligan and criminal underground.[637][845] By the mid-1990s, the hooligan scene of FC Berlin had developed a connection to the eastern Berlin bouncer scene.[387] The eastern Berlin bouncer scene would eventually be almost completely organized from the hooligan scene of BFC Dynamo.[799][846] One of those involved in the assault on French policeman Daniel Nivel during the 1998 FIFA World Cup had connections to the hooligan scene of FC Berlin.[637] The same man was later linked to organized crime and eventfully involved in a high-profile drug trafficking case.[847][848][637]\\n\\nThe match between BFC Dynamo and Berlin Türkspor 1965 in the final of the 1998–99 Berlin Cup on 11 May 1999 was marked by violence. Supporters of BFC Dynamo directed far-right chants and others provocations against Berlin Türkspor 1965 during the match.[849] 400 supporters of BFC Dynamo invaded the pitch after the final whistle to celebrate the title. Some supporters also attacked players of Berlin Türkspor 1965. Two players of Berlin Türkspor 1965 were injured, one of them had suffered a stab wound.[850] BFC Dynamo Club President Volkmar Wanski was able to prevent a total escalation by giving a calming speech over the stadium microphone.[851] He immediately apologized for the behavior of the supporters at the press conference after the match.[850] Older supporters of BFC Dynamo openly expressed their contempt for the far-right supporters that had visited the match.[852] BFC Dynamo and Berlin Türkspor 1965 agreed to meet in a friendly match later in the season and to organize a joint meal for players and responsible.[853] Wanski made it clear in the speakers ahead of the last home match against FC Rot-Weiß Erfurt in the 1998-99 Regionalliga Nordost on 15 May 1999 that \\\"anyone who cannot behave has no business in our stadium\\\".[854]\\n\\nSerious riots broke out in Prenzlauer Berg after the match between BFC Dynamo and 1. FC Union Berlin in the Round of 16 of the 2000–01 Berlin Cup at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark on 24 March 2001. Around 150 supporters of BFC Dynamo attacked the police after the match, as they wanted to storm the block of Union Berlin.[855][342] Around 500 supporters of BFC Dynamo then attacked police at Eberswalder Straße.[342] The police employed water cannons against supporters at Eberswalder Straße and Schönhauser Allee. Nine people, including four police officers, were injured.[855][342] BFC Dynamo Club President Karin Halsch (de) and 1. FC Union Berlin Club President Heiner Bertram criticized the police in unison for provocations during the match and for triggering riots.[341] Karin Halsch simultaneously expressed sadness that the riots destroyed a lot of reconstruction work in the club and announced that there would be many stadium bans.[341][856] Also coach Jürgen Bogs spoke out about \\\"senseless violence\\\" that would once again fall back on the club, but also criticized the police for provocations.[341] Many of those involved in the riots did not come from the supporter scene of BFC Dynamo. Many were visitors from other cities in Germany.[387]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo had the highest number of violent supporters in Germany in 2005.[857] Violence broke out during the match between Tennis Borussia Berlin and BFC Dynamo in the 2004-05 NOFV-Oberliga Nord at the Mommsenstadion on 11 February 2005. A flare was lit and a couple of bangers set off in the guest block at the beginning of the second half. Police then decided to intervene against away supporters. Police officers were pelted with beer cups and attacked by supporters of BFC Dynamo when they entered gest block. Eight police officers were injured and 11 supporters of BFC Dynamo arrested. BFC Dynamo criticized the police operation as \\\"disproportionate\\\".[858][431] Supporters of BFC Dynamo claimed that they had been called \\\"Nazis\\\", \\\"Ossis\\\" and \\\"Unioners\\\" by police officers. Riots had broken out also when Tennis Borussia Berlin played 1. FC Union Berlin in round of 16 of the 2004-05 Berlin Cup at the Mommsenstadion a couple of weeks before.[431]\\n\\nFighting between supporters of BFC Dynamo and police again broke out in connection with the match between BFC Dynamo and SV Yeşilyurt at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark on 24 April 2005. The mood had been tense during the match. The situation escalated when celebrating supporters of BFC Dynamo attacked the fence after the final whistle. Police intervened with water hoses, batons and tear gas against supporters of BFC Dynamo. Four police officers were injured and five hooligans arrested. One police officer suffered a broken nose and another one a concussion.[859][860] Riots again broke out in connection to a match between BFC Dynamo and SV Yeşilyurt at the opening of the 2005-06 NOFV-Oberliga Nord at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark 5 August 2005. The match was attended by 1,200 supporters of BFC Dynamo. Hooligans in the crowd threw bottles and stones at police officers during the match. Fights between hooligans and police then broke out after match. Around 150 hooligans had participated in the riots, according to police information.[861][438] BFC Dynamo spokesperson Yiannis Kaufmann claimed that those involved were a \\\"mob of travelling fans who wants to cause trouble everywhere and now discredit the BFC\\\".[861] As many as 13 police officers were injured in the riots.[439][440]\\n\\n\\nThe Stadion im Sportforum on 14 May 2006.\\nPolice made a controversial raid against the discotheque Jeton in Friedrichshain where supporters of BFC Dynamo and other people had gathered to celebrate in connection to a fan tournament in memory of Mike Polley on the night of 20 August 2005. The fan tournament had been visited by numerous teams, including teams from FC St. Pauli, 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig, Aberdeen F.C., VfL Bochum and Malmö FF.[862][863][864] The large-scale police operation involved 300 officers, including 100 members of the SEK.[865][866][867] 158 persons were arrested. Among the detainees were 19 Category C-supporters and 22 Category B-supporters.[439][866] Supporters filed numerous complaints against the police for use of excessive violence.[868] 39 people at the discotheque were injured.[440] Also bystanders were affected.[440] Police initially claimed they had been pelted with bottles and furnishings, but later corrected their statement and admitted that there had been no resistance.[865][440][439] The police had allegedly beaten defenseless people.[869] Police stated that the raid was a preventative measure on short notice to prevent hooligans from organizing for the upcoming match against Union Berlin on 21 August 2005.[440][866] There were speculations that police also took revenge for riots during the match between BFC Dynamo and SV Yeşilyurt at the opening of the season.[440][439] More than 1,000 police officers were deployed to the derby and the match was played without crowd trouble.[866][867] Banners in solidarity with the supporters of BFC Dynamo were displayed in 17 football stadiums across Germany during the following matchdays.[870]\\n\\nThe return match between BFC Dynamo and Union Berlin in the 2005–06 NOFV-Oberliga Nord was played at the Stadion im Sportforum on 13 May 2006. The standing was 1–1 when supporters of BFC Dynamo invaded the pitch in an attempt to storm the block of Union Berlin around the 75th minute.[871] Supporters of Union Berlin fled in panic.[872] The match was abandoned and Union Berlin was awarded a 2–0 win.[871][873] The players of BFC Dynamo wore the motto \\\"No power of violence\\\" on their shirts in the following match against BFC Preussen away on 17 May 2006.[874] The Stadion im Sportforum was temporarily closed for matches in the NOFV-Oberliga Nord after the riots.[457] The riots during the match against 1. FC Union Berlin threw the club into a financial crisis. Treasurer Sven Radicke concluded: \\\"Four years of our work were ruined in five minutes\\\".[459]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo has often attracted hooligans from outside, and hooligans who are otherwise not involved in the supporter scene, to high-profile matches.[520][875][530] The club has repeatedly complained about so-called \\\"riot tourists\\\".[530][876] Riots broke out after the match against Berliner AK 07 in the final of the 2009–10 Berlin Cup at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark on 2 June 2010. Around 100–150 supporters of BFC Dynamo attempted to invade the pitch after the final whistle.[519][875] Match stewards and players of BFC Dynamo threw themselves in to restrain supporters and prevent further riots.[519][877][875][520] One of them was goalkeeper Nico Thomaschewski, who later received an award from the Berlin Football Association (BFV) for his actions.[875] Polish fans of Pogoń Szczecin were allegedly linked to the riots.[875] Those who had invaded the pitch were whistled by other supporters of BFC Dynamo when they returned to the stands.[878]\\n\\nMajor riots then occurred after the match against 1. FC Kaiserslautern in the first round of the 2011-12 DFB-Pokal at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark on 3 July 2011.[528][529] Around 200–300 supporters of BFC Dynamo invaded the buffer zone and stormed the guest block after the match.[530][520] 18 police officers and many supporters from Kaiserslautern were injured in the attack.[520] The Chairman of the Economic Council Peter Meyer openly expressed his embarrassment and disappointment over the behavior of some supporters and publicly apologized.[530] There were allegations that hooligans outside the BFC Dynamo environment had been involved.[530] While the police stated that most of those arrested were from Berlin, the club claimed it had never seen most of the recent perpetrators before.[520]\\n\\nThe contemporary supporter scene\\nThe contemporary supporter scene contains various subcultures and categories of supporters. It ranges from older supporters to younger ultras.[749] Older supporters constitute an essential part of the supporter scene.[752] Many are active in the supporter group 79er.[875] The group is credited for its commitment to the club, notably the youth teams. Its members have been supporters of BFC Dynamo since the late 1970s.[875][717]\\n\\nThe supporter scene played an important part in saving the club from bankruptcy in 2001.[637] Supporters organized a demonstration against the impending bankruptcy. The demonstration marched from the Sportforum to the Rotes Rathaus where it was met by the former club president and SPD politician Karin Halsch.[368][369] Supporters threw parties and organized collections, made donations and travelled to countries such as Austria and Switzerland to convince creditors to accept smaller pay-offs in order to save the cub.[637] Supporters also installed bucket seats at the Stadion im Sportforum and built a new clubhouse in the Sportforum during the insolvency.[729][879] The insolvency crisis remains a defining moment for older supporters.[637] The supporter scene has traditionally arranged an annual Mike-Polley-Gedenkturnier, which is a football fan tournament in memory of Mike Polley.[822][880] The first edition of the fan tournament was arranged in the Sportforum Hohenschönhausen in 2003 and comprised 28 teams.[881] A march in memory of Mike Polley in Leipzig in 2018 was attended by 850 supporters of BFC Dynamo.[882]\\n\\nNew groups of younger ultra-oriented supporters have emerged since the 2000s.[875][717] Supporter group Fraktion H was founded in 2006 by younger supporters who wanted to create more atmosphere in the stadium.[875][717] A minor ultras scene then emerged with the founding of supporter group Ultras BFC in 2011. The ultras of BFC Dynamo have initiated campaigns such as \\\"Brown is not Claret\\\" and have also engaged in football tournaments for refugees.[845][717][883][608] The club has encouraged the new groups of younger supporters and club management has taken a stand against racism and right-wing extremism.[884][883][608] Fraktion H maintains a friendship with the supporters of Eintracht Trier, while members of the now dissolved Ultras BFC have had contacts with the ultras of Swedish football club GAIS.[885]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo is affiliated with Fanprojekt Berlin, which is an independent organization that engages in socio-pedagogical fan work.[752][886] The organization supports young fans in various aspects of life and aims at promoting a positive supporter culture.[886] BFC Dynamo engages in active fan work and has taken measures to control violent elements, to exclude known violators and to distance itself from radical supporters.[752][530][883] Far-right symbols and slogans are not tolerated by the club.[752] The Chairman of the Economic Council, Peter Meyer, stated publicly in connection with a friendly match against Hertha BSC in 2007 that the club did not want people who cannot follow the rules and that \\\"anyone who shouts Nazi slogans will be thrown out of the stadium\\\".[495] Lawyer and former Vice President of BFC Dynamo René Lau said in an interview with Deutsche Welle in 2019: \\\"If you had asked me 25 years ago [if BFC had a problem with Nazis], I would have said yes. But is today\'s BFC Dynamo a Nazi club? I would vehemently dispute that.\\\"[637] A large number of stadium bans has been issued by the club since the mid-2000s.[887][530] A total of 40 stadium bans was issued only in 2006.[888][887] No riots has occurred since 2011.[752]\\n\\nThe contemporary supporter scene has includes groups such as 79er, Mythos BFC, Fraktion H, Piefkes, Ultras BFC, East Company, Riot Sport, Black Boys Dynamo, Bärenbande, Gegengerade, Hipstercrew, Märkische Jungs, Sektion Süddeutschland and Banda Invicta.[875][889][717][890] Supporter group Gegengerade is a left wing-oriented fan club.[890] A number of supporters BFC Dynamo had been members of the \\\"Anti-Fascist Football Fan Initiative\\\" (AFFI) aleady back in 1993.[891][892] Supporters of BFC Dynamo have occasionally displayed a Norwegian flag with the text \\\"Thanks Norway\\\", in memory of Norway\'s 2–0 win over Nazi Germany in the quarter-finals of the 1936 Summer Olympics. Another banner that has occasionally been displayed at the stadium contains the text \\\"There Is A Light That Never Goes Out\\\", with reference to the 1980s British cult band The Smiths.[893]\\n\\nUltras BFC announced its dissolution on 23 January 2023, after the group had lost essential material in an attack. An individual in the group was attacked by a group of people in front of his private residence and robbed of essential group material. The group apologized to the supporter scene of BFC Dynamo and consequently dissolved, but at the same time announced that this was not the end.[894] The attack has been traced to Cottbus.[895] A new supporter group named Banda Invicta eventually presented itself with a banner and a coreography on the first matchday of the 2023-24 Regionalliga Nordost on 29 July 2023. The coreography read \\\"On to a new chapter\\\".[896]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo had 100 Category C and 190 Category-B supporters in 2019.[897] Younger hooligans of BFC Dynamo have contacts with supporter group Kaliber 030 at Hertha.[637][898] 20–25 supporters of BFC Dynamo joined Hertha in the guest block of the Stadion an der Alten Försterei during the derby between Union Berlin and Hertha on 2 November 2019.[899] Older hooligans of BFC Dynamo, on the other hand, maintain friendly relationships with like-minded supporters of 1. FC Magdeburg.[637] Supporters of BFC Dynamo wanted to travel in numbers to the return leg against VfB Oldenburg in the promotion play-offs for the 3. Liga on 4 June 2022. Up to 2,500 supporters of BFC Dynamo wanted to join the team in Oldenburg.[900] Around 1,300 supporters of BFC Dynamo was eventually admitted to the Marschweg-Stadion, where they marked their presence with a banner, a scarf choreography and flares.[901][902][903]\\n\\nOne of the most well-known books in Germany about the supporter scene of BFC Dynamo is \\\"Der BFC war schuld am Mauerbau\\\" by German author Andreas Gläser (de). The book was first published in 2002 and describes the supporter scene from the late 1970s and forward. The club, its reputation and supporter scene, was also the theme of stage play \\\"Dynamoland\\\" by Gudrun Herrbold. The play was set up in 2007 and involved young football players from BFC Dynamo as well as Andreas Gläser.[784][520][904] The fanzine \\\"Zugriff\\\" is dedicated to BFC Dynamo. The fanzine has been produced by Andreas Gläser and members of supporter group Gegengerade since 2008.[905] The tenth and latest issue was published in 2014. The tenth issue came with as music CD mixed by Andreas Gläser. The CD included numerous ska and punk tracks as well as a 25 seconds long recording of Erich Mielke ranting about skinheads and punks.[749]\\n\\nMusicians from German rock band Klaus Renft Combo composed the anthem \\\"Auf, Dynamo!\\\" for BFC Dynamo in 1999.[906] German rap musician Joe Rilla has also dedicated a song to BFC Dynamo. The song is called \\\"Heb die Faust Hoch (BFC Dynamo Straßenhymne)\\\" and was released in 2008. Joe Rilla, whose real name is Hagen Stoll (de), has a background in the hooligan scene of BFC Dynamo.[907] The clothing store Hoolywood on Schönhauser Allee in Prenzlauer Berg is associated with the supporter scene of BFC Dynamo. The store was founded at the beginning of the 1990s.[752][904][908] The store has been an advertising partner of BFC Dynamo.[909]\\n\\nRivalries\\nSG Dynamo Dresden\\nThe oldest rival of BFC Dynamo is SG Dynamo Dresden. The rivalry dates back to 1954 when the team of Dynamo Dresden and its place in the DDR-Oberliga was transferred to SC Dynamo Berlin during the course of the 1954-55 season. The relocation aroused a sense of victimhood among the fans of Dynamo Dresden which would later be compounded by the successes of BFC Dynamo.[758] Matters were exacerbated when additional players of Dynamo Dresden were delegated to Dynamo Berlin by the German Football Association of the GDR (DFV) following the relegation of Dynamo Dresden after the 1962–63 season.[910] The antagonism between the two clubs was underpinned by a historical German rivalry between Prussian Berlin and Saxony.[719][911] It was fueled by contemporary resentment in Dresden at the better provision of housing and consumer goods in the East German capital.[719] East Berliners were generally unpopular outside the city limits, especially in the southern regional districts of East Germany. They were considered arrogant and clearly preferred.[751]\\n\\nDynamo Dresden slowly recovered from the relocation. The club was declared a regional district center of excellence (German: Leistungszentrum) by the regional district board of the DTSB on 5 August 1968.[912][913] The club could now draw on the best players in Bezirk Dresden.[912] Dynamo Dresden eventually re-established itself in the DDR-Oberliga and became campions once again in the 1970-71 DDR-Oberliga. BFC Dynamo and Dynamo Dresden then met in the final of the 1970-71 FDGB-Pokal. Klaus Sammer scored 1-0 for Dynamo Dresden, but Norbert Johannsen equalized on a penalty. Dynamo Dresden eventually won the match 2-1 after a second goal by Sammer in extra time.[57] Dynamo Dresden thus secured the first Double in the history of East German football.[914] However, BFC Dynamo did not go completely empty-handed from the final. The team qualified for its first UEFA competition as runners-up. Its participation in the 1971–72 European Cup Winners\' Cup would be a success.\\n\\n\\nA duel between Harald Schütze (left) and Reinhard Häfner of Dynamo Dresden (right) during a match between BFC Dynamo and Dynamo Dresden in the DDR-Oberliga in 1976.\\nBFC Dynamo met Dynamo Dresden away on the sixth matchday of the 1974-75 DDR-Oberliga on 21 September 1974. The standing was 2–2 at the end of the match, after an equalizer from Norbert Johannsen on a penalty. Shortly before the final whistle, referee Robert Pischke from Rostock awarded Dynamo Dresden a controversial penalty. Siegmar Wätzlich converted the penalty and Dynamo Dresden won the match 3–2.[915][916] The East German football weekly Die neue Fußballwoche (FuWo) commented: \\\"Shortly before the end, the same thing on the other side, but this one surprised even the objective Dresdeners about it. They hadn\'t seen any opposing influence on the falling Richter... The Berliners exploded in outrage at the penalty kick, which snatched a point from them in the last minute.\\\"[916] Dynamo Dresden finished the season in third place, two points ahead of BFC Dynamo. BFC Dynamo finished the season in fourth place, but with a better goal difference. Dynamo Dresden had thus captured the place in the 1975-76 UEFA Cup narrowly ahead of BFC Dynamo. Referee Pischke was not selected for any more DDR-Oberliga matches and eventually chose to end his refereeing career.[917] He would years later become the president of F.C. Hansa Rostock.[918]\\n\\nDynamo Dresden would come to dominate East German football in the 1970s. The team managed to capture a third consecutive league title in the 1977–78 DDR-Oberliga. What happened after is subject to various rumors. Formal title celebrations took place in June 1978 at the hotel and restaurant Bastein at Prager Straße in Dresden. Erich Mielke paid a visit as the president of SV Dynamo to congratulate the team to the title. Dynamo Dresden player Reinhard Häfner recalls how Mielke held a speech where he said that he would be happier if BFC Dynamo was champions. Mielke should have added that \\\"since BFC Dynamo is also SV Dynamo, the title stays in the family, so to speak, and that is good too\\\". According to other versions of the same event, he allegedly proclaimed that everything will be done so that in the coming year, the champion will come from Berlin, and that it was now the turn of the BFC Dynamo.[919][920][921][922][nb 15]\\n\\n\\nThomas Doll and defending Matthias Döschner of Dynamo Dresden during a match between Dynamo Dresden and BFC Dynamo in 1987.\\nBFC Dynamo stood out among other clubs within SV Dynamo. The club was located at the frontline of the Cold War. It was also a representative of the capital of East Germany. This meant that the club had to be well equipped.[67] BFC Dynamo would come to benefit from a nationwide scouting system, supported by 33 training centers (TZ) of SV Dynamo across East Germany.[68][927] No less than 40 full-time trainers worked for the club.[928] The team embarked on a period of unparalleled success in the 1978–79 season under young coach Jürgen Bogs. Dynamo Dresden had been the dominant team in East German football until then. BFC Dynamo would now be its main obstacle to success.[nb 16]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo opened the 1978-79 DDR-Oberliga with ten consecutive wins. The team thus broke the previous record of Dynamo Dresden of seven consecutive wins from the 1972-73 DDR-Oberliga. Dynamo Dresden, on the other hand, had a moderately successful start to the season and stood in second place. The two teams met in the 11th matchday in front of 33,000 spectators at Dynamo-Stadion in Dresden on 2 December 1978.[934] The match ended in a draw 1-1 after an equalizer by Hans-Jürgen Riediger for BFC Dynamo. The match was marked by crowd trouble, with 38 fans to both teams arrested.[4] 17 of the 38 fans arrested were fans of BFC Dynamo.[935] Inexperienced linesman Günter Supp should allegedly have missed an offside position on Riediger in the situation leading up to the equalizer.[936][937] There were accusations in Dresden that the match had been manipulated by the referees in favor of BFC Dynamo.[4][180][201] This alleged manipulation was cited as yet another example of discrimination against the Saxon city in comparison with East Berlin.[4][180] BFC Dynamo continued to lead the league for the rest of the season. The team finally secured its first DDR-Oberliga title after defeating Dynamo Dresden 3–1 in the 24th match day in front of 22,000 spectators at Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark on 6 June 1979.[938]\\n\\nThe 1979-80 DDR-Oberliga would be tight race between the two rivals. Dynamo Dresden led the league for most of the season. Dynamo Dresden was still in first place before the last matchday. However, BFC Dynamo was only one point behind. The two rivals met at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark in the last matchday of the league season on 10 May 1980. Dynamo Dresden only needed a draw to win the league title. There was huge excitement around the match and the stadium was sold out. Die neue Fußballwoche (FuWo) reported on \\\"international match atmosphere\\\".[939] The standing was 0-0 for a long time. Dynamo Dresden player Peter Kotte fell in the BFC Dynamo penalty area with about 15 minutes left of regular time, but Dynamo Dresden was denied a penalty.[940] Norbert Trieloff instead scored a goal for BFC Dynamo just a moment later. BFC Dynamo eventually won the match 1-0 and captured its second consecutive league title in front of 30,000 spectators. Dynamo Dresden would not come this close to BFC Dynamo in the league until the end of the 1980s. It was rumoured that referee Hans Kulicke from Oderberg had favored BFC Dynamo. However, also BFC Dynamo had been denied a chance to decide the match. A goal by Hartmut Pelka had been disallowed by referee Kulicke due to a foul on Dynamo Dresden goalkeeper Bernd Jakubowski.[921]\\n\\nBoth clubs were affiliated to SV Dynamo and supported by the security organs. However, BFC Dynamo was more associated with the Stasi, while Dynamo Dresden was more associated with the Volkspolizei.[941] BFC Dynamo was known as the favourite club of the head of the Stasi Erich Mielke.[942] Dynamo Dresden, on the other hand, was patronaged by Volkspolizei Lieutenant general Willi Nyffenegger. Nyffenegger was the long-time head of the regional district authority of the Volkspolizei in Bezirk Dresden.[943] However, also Dynamo Dresden had supporters in the Stasi. The Stasi had helped Dynamo Dresden to obtain secret information about the line-up of FC Bayern Munich before the match between Dynamo Dresden and FC Bayern Munich in the 1973–74 European Cup on 7 November 1973.[944] Dynamo Dresden would also be supported by Stasi Major general Horst Böhm in the 1980s.[945] Böhm was the head of the regional district administration of the Stasi in Bezirk Dresden.[946][947][758] He was a committed local patriot when it came to Dynamo Dresden and a sponsoring member of the club.[948][947][949] The antagonism between the two clubs also spread to the Stasi Guards Regiment \\\"Felix E. Dzerzhinsky\\\".[719][4] The behavior of members of a Dresden unit during a match between the two teams in 1985 was likened to that of \\\"rioting fans\\\" by another Stasi officer.[719] Some Stasi guards had hurled abuse at BFC Dynamo players, shouting \\\"Bent champions!\\\" as they left the pitch.[758]\\n\\nResentment in Dresden over the rise of BFC Dynamo was worsened when three top players of Dynamo Dresden, Gerd Weber, Peter Kotte and Matthias Müller, were arrested on suspicion of planning to defect to West Germany in 1981.[950][4] Weber had solicited plans to defect, but the other two had not.[951] Weber received a prison sentence and a lifetime ban from playing football at any level in East Germany, while Kotte and Müller received lifetime bans from playing in the top two tiers for alleged complicity.[950][4][952] Neither would return to the Oberliga. The punishment against the three players led to rumors and protests in Dresden.[950] They also fueled local patriotism and anti-Berlin sentiments in Dresden.[950]\\n\\nFans of Dynamo Dresden saw the lifetime bans on Weber, Kotte and Müller as \\\"an order from Erich Mielke\\\" designed to weaken Dynamo Dresden.[950] Also, Kotte and Klaus Sammer has claimed they were part of a delibate plan by Mielke to weaken Dynamo Dresden.[953][954] However, such claims are doubtful.[953] The three players had been reported by an unofficial collaborator (IM) and Mielke was convinced that all three were originally prepared to defect.[951][953] Kotte was not an isolated case. The great fear of footballers, fans and officials who had fled East Germany was omnipresent at the Stasi.[955] Kotte and Müller knew about the intentions of Weber.[950] Their failure to inform authorities was critical.[950] Former SED First Secretary in Bezik Dresden Hans Modrow concludes that the measures against the three were \\\"generally cautious\\\", given the completely different consequences for other East German citizens in similar contexts. After all, the three were also members of the armed organs (German: Bewaffnete Organe der DDR) with ranks.[956] Müller said in an interview with Dresdner Neueste Nachrichten in 2011 that he \\\"knew one hundred percent\\\" that the uncompromising actions against the three players were a deliberate attempt by the Stasi to weaken Dynamo Dresden in order to secure the supremacy of BFC Dynamo.[957]\\n\\n\\nBFC Dynamo midfielder Bernd Schulz celebrates a goal against Dynamo Dresden in the DFV-Supercup together with Thomas Doll (left) and Jörg Fügner (right) in 1989.\\nBFC Dynamo and Dynamo Dresden would be the two main contenders for titles in East German football during the 1980s. BFC Dynamo dominated the DDR-Oberliga and won consecutive titles, while Dynamo Dresden had major success in the FDGB-Pokal. The two teams met in the 1981-82 FDGB-Pokal and 1983-84 FDGB-Pokal final. Dynamo Dresden won both finals and thus stopped BFC Dynamo from completing the Double.[940] The teams then also met in the 1984-85 FDGB-Pokal final. The performance of the referees in the final was controversial. A review by the DFV found that 30 percent of the referee decisions during the match had been wrong, and that 80 percent of those had been of disadvantage to Dynamo Dresden.[958] Referee Manfred Roßner was banned one year from officiating matches above second tier after the final.[959][960][958] However, nothing emerged that indicated that Roßner had been bought by the Stasi.[961] Dynamo Dresden won the final 3–2 in front of 48,000 spectators at the Stadion der Weltjugend. It was the fourth loss for BFC Dynamo against Dynamo Dresden in the final of the FDGB-Pokal and the third time that Dynamo Dresden had stopped the team from completing the Double.[940] However, BFC Dynamo would eventually succeed in completing the Double in the 1987–88 season, defeating FC Carl Zeiss Jena 2–0 in final of the 1987–88 FDGB-Pokal.\\n\\nDisturbances by spectators was a regular occurrence at matches between the two teams.[758] BFC Dynamo was met by immense hostility during away matches in Dresden. Fans of BFC Dynamo would respond to the hatred they met by singing chants in praise of Erich Mielke as a provocation.[758][178] They also made fun of the food shortage in Dresden.[753] Fans of BFC Dynamo are known to have brought coveted tropical fruits, that were only available in East Berlin, to away matches in Saxony. The fruits were then thrown at the home crowd.[178][753][751][nb 17] In Dresden they threw green bananas at the home fans and shouted: \\\"We brought you something - Bananas, bananas!\\\".[753] East German state television would always try to hide riots from viewers and sound engineers also had to drown out chants that were considered negative, such as \\\"Stasi out\\\". The match between BFC Dynamo and SG Dynamo Dresden was the most explosive encounter. At one point, the match between BFC Dynamo and SG Dynamo Dresden was even ordered to be recorded completely without sound.[776] A group of about 250 hooligans of Dynamo Dresden chanted anti-Semitic slogans against BFC Dynamo, such as \\\"Berlin Jews!\\\" and \\\"Jews\' sow!, during the match between the two teams in the 1987-88 DDR-Oberliga in East Berlin on 6 April 1988.[792][963] A number of supporters of SG Dynamo Dresden were then allegedly arrested after the match.[963]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo\'s ten-year dominance in the league was eventually broken by Dynamo Dresden in the 1988–89 season. BFC Dynamo won a second consecutive cup title in the 1988-89 FDGB-Pokal, but Dynamo Dresden became the new champion in the 1988-89 DDR-Oberliga. BFC Dynamo and Dynamo Dresden then met in the first ever DFV-Supercup in 1989. BFC Dynamo won the match 4–1 in front of 22,347 spectators at the Stadion der Freundschaft in Cottbus and became the first and only winner of the DFV-Supercup in the history of East German football.\\n\\nBFC Dynamo and Dynamo Dresden met 60 times in the Oberliga, FDGB-Pokal and DFV-Supercup between 1966 and 1991. BFC Dynamo won 21 matches and Dynamo Dresden won 27 matches. BFC Dynamo and Dynamo Dresden also met 10 times in the Regionalliga Nordost between 1995 and 2000. BFC Dynamo won 3 matches and Dynamo Dresden won 5 matches. The last meeting ended 1–1 and took place in the 1999-00 Regionalliga Nordost on 26 April 2000. The two teams rarely meet these days, because Dynamo Dresden regularly appears in the second or third tier of the German football league system. Former Dynamo Dresden player Ralf Minge expressed in an interview in 2018 his satisfaction that Dynamo Dresden has advanced past BFC Dynamo, but also said that he would not mind new duels with BFC Dynamo and that duels with BFC Dynamo \\\"have a certain charm\\\".[964]\\n\\n1. FC Union Berlin\\nFurther information: Berlin derby\\nBFC Dynamo and 1. FC Union Berlin were founded only a few days apart. Both clubs were formed during the reorganization of East German football in December 1965 and January 1966, when the football departments of ten sports clubs (SC) were reorganized into dedicated football clubs.[965] However, Union Berlin was not part of the original plan. Two football clubs had already been planned for East Berlin. They were to be formed from the football departments of SC Dynamo Berlin and ASK Vorwärts Berlin.[64] In addition, TSC Berlin played only in the second tier DDR-Liga at the time.[965][64] The founding of Union Berlin probably owed much to the intervention of the powerful Herbert Warnke.[965][762][966] Herbert Warnke was the chairman of the national state trade union FDGB and a member of the SED Politburo.[965] Dynamo Berlin and Vorwärts Berlin were both associated with the armed and security organs.[965][64] Herbert Warnke therefore argued for the formation of a civilian club for the working people of East Berlin.[965][64] He would be a passionate fan of Union Berlin.[967] Another high-ranking SED politician who pushed for the founding a civilian football club in East Berlin was the SED First Secretary in East Berlin and SED Politburo member Paul Verner.[968] Verner held a speech at the founding ceremony of Union Berlin.[969]\\n\\nBoth BFC Dynamo and Union Berlin belonged to the elite in East German football.[762][970] The new football clubs were intended as centers of excellence, with the right to draw on talents within designated geographical areas.[4][64] BFC Dynamo was supported by the Stasi, while Union Berlin was supported by the FDGB.[971][972][nb 18] However, Union Berlin was able to trace its origins back to FC Olympia Oberschöneweide in 1906.[753] BFC Dynamo had no history before East Germany. The supporters of Union Berlin therefore considered their club to be a genuine football club, unlike BFC Dynamo.[762] However, even as a civilian club, Union Berlin was also part of the sports political system.[177][975][65] The founding of the Union Berlin was organized by the then SED First Secretary in Köpenick Hans Modrow.[976] Like Herbert Warnke, Hans Modrow would be a sponsoring member of the club.[971][976] The most important positions on the board of Union Berlin were exclusively held by directors of state-owned factories or SED representatives.[65] Union Berlin was state-funded and all decisions in club had to be reported to the all-powerful central sports agency DTSB.[975] The DTSB stood in turn under direct control of the SED Central Committee.[977]\\n\\nThe rivalry between BFC Dynamo and Union Berlin began in the mid-1960s. It was initially based on the geographical proximity to each other.[66] BFC Dynamo and Union Berlin were two clubs from East Berlin in the DDR-Oberliga.[66] BFC Dynamo struggled in the 1966-67 DDR-Oberliga and was threatened with relegation. The feud between the two clubs began when fans of Union Berlin mocked BFC Dynamo with a banner saying \\\"We greet the relegated\\\" during a league match at the Stadion an der Alten Försterei on 26 April 1967.[45][972] Union Berlin won the match by 3–0 and BFC Dynamo was eventually relegated to the DDR-Liga at the end of the season.[45] While BFC Dynamo was playing in the second tier DDR-Liga, Union Berlin surprisingly won the 1967–68 FDGB-Pokal.[762] However, BFC Dynamo immediately bounced back and managed to establish itself in the DDR-Oberliga. Union Berlin would then itself be relegated to the DDR-Liga after the 1968-69 DDR-Oberliga, but also managed to return to the DDR-Oberliga after just one season in the second tier. Union Berlin would be the stronger of the two teams until the 1970s.[978]\\n\\nThe rivalry between the two clubs intensified in the early 1970s.[66] The player of Union Berlin, Klaus Korn, was suspended after a heated derby in the 1970–71 DDR-Oberliga at the Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum on 28 October 1970.[66][45] The performance of the referees had been \\\"catastrophic\\\" according to private notes from the then Second Club Secretary and Vice President of Union Berlin Günter Mielis, and the match ended with riots.[66][979][980] Klaus Korn had insulted players in BFC Dynamo with slurs such as \\\"Stasi-pig\\\". The DFV Legal Commission imposed a one-year ban on Klaus Korn after a circumstantial trial.[981][982] The DFV Legal Commission also demanded that Union Berlin considered his exclusion from the club. Klaus Korn was then excluded from the club and would never play in the DDR-Oberliga again.[981][982][66][45] Unrest broke out again at a derby in Hohenschönhausen one year later. Eight spectators were arrested after the match between BFC Dynamo and Union Berlin in the 1971–72 DDR-Oberliga at the Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum on 28 December 1971.[983] The match was attended by 14,000 spectators and the stadium was sold out.[984][712]\\n\\nThe football landscape in East Berlin changed before the 1971–72 season. Vorwärts Berlin was relocated to Frankfurt an der Oder on 31 July 1971. BFC Dynamo and Union Berlin were from now on the only major football clubs in East Berlin.[985] The relocation meant that BFC Dynamo could now take over the role of the dominant team for the armed organs in East Berlin. The team would also have opportunity to eventually move into the larger and more centrally located Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark, which led to increased interest in the club and growing attendance numbers.[66] The districts in East Berlin had previously been divided between BFC Dynamo, Vorwärts Berlin and Union Berlin. Each club was able to recruit young players from training centers (TZ) in their districts.[64][65] All training centers that had previously belonged to Vorwärts Berlin were now given to BFC Dynamo.[64][65] The DTSB allegedly saw more potential in BFC Dynamo.[64] BFC Dynamo now had access to two thirds of all training centers (TZ) in East Berlin.[65][35] This meant that BFC Dynamo had gained a much stronger position in East Berlin than Union Berlin when it came to recruiting young players.[978] FC Vorwärts Frankfurt was given Bezirk Potsdam as a catchment area, in addition to Bezirk Frankfurt. Bezirk Potsdam had previously been assigned to Union Berlin and thus had to be handed over to Vorwärts Frankfurt. This further weakened Union Berlin in relation to BFC Dynamo.[986][65][nb 19]\\n\\nUnion Berlin was relegated to the DDR-Liga after the 1972–73 season. The Union Berlin star and national team player Reinhard Lauck was transferred to BFC Dynamo after the relegation.[987] The loss of Lauck was a hard blow for the team. Lauck had contributed greatly to the victory in the final of the 1967–68 FDGB-Pokal and was well-liked among the supporters of Union Berlin.[987] Supporters of Union Berlin are said to have gathered outside his apartment, to appeal to him to stay in the team and play in the second tier.[988][989] But Lauck had already decided to change team.[988][990] The DFV had allegedly advised him to switch to BFC Dynamo in order to continue playing in the national team.[987] According to a regulation in the 1970 DFV Football Resolution (German: DFV-Fußballbeschluss), national team players in clubs that had been relegated from the DDR-Oberliga should switch clubs in order to remain competitive.[991] Lauck would make a successful appearance for East Germany in the 1974 FIFA World Cup and would win gold with East Germany in the 1976 Summer Olympics.[987][989] Lauck became the team captain of BFC Dynamo in the 1974–75 season.[82] He would later win two league titles with BFC Dynamo before ending his career due to a knee injury.[989][992]\\n\\nUnion Berlin would remain in the DDR-Liga for several seasons. Instead of playing matches against BFC Dynamo in the DDR-Oberliga, the team was now left to compete with the reserve team of BFC Dynamo, the BFC Dynamo II. Union Berlin would also suffer more blows which further weakened its position in relation to BFC Dynamo. Herbert Warnke passed in 1975 and was replaced as chairman of the FDGB by Harry Tisch.[971] Harry Tisch had begun his political career in Rostock and chose instead to give the support of the FDGB to F.C. Hansa Rostock.[971] Union Berlin thus lost the support of the FDGB and also no longer had any support in the top of the political hierarchy.[993] From no on, the club could only rely on support from the district administration of the SED in East Berlin and local state-owned enterprises, such as VEB Kabelwerk Oberspree (KWO) and VEB Transformatorenwerk Oberschöneweide (TRO).[994][971]\\n\\nThe DTSB and the DFV had also continued their efforts to concentrate resources on a few clubs during the 1970s.[995] A number of football clubs became specially promoted focus clubs in the 1970 DFV Football Resolution.[60][996] The focus clubs were meant to be strengthened through player transfers. Players in teams that had been relegated from the DDR-Oberliga should also switch to focus clubs.[997] The focus clubs were also equipped with more staff as well as better material and technical conditions.[998][60][996] BFC Dynamo became the focus club in East Berlin.[999][1000][995][nb 20] Even more advantages were then given to the focus clubs in the 1976 DFV Football Resolution. The focus clubs would now be allowed to delegate youth players from other football clubs. They would also be provided with more youth coaches from the DFV and have the right to accommodate twice as many students in their affiliated Children and Youth Sports Schools (KJS) every year, compared to other football clubs.[1001][999][1002] Union Berlin would now have to delegate some of its best young players to BFC Dynamo.[978][nb 21] One example was the talented Detlef Helms, who was delegated to BFC Dynamo as a 17-year-old in 1977.[65][970]\\n\\nUnion Berlin returned to the Oberliga in the 1976–77 season. Stadion an der Alten Försterei was a small football stadium without cinder tracks where the crowd stood close to the pitch.[762][990] Union Berlin had become the focus of hooligan attention.[719] Matches at the Stadion an der Alten Föresterei had regularly been interrupted by spectators throwing objects on the pitch.[1003] The derby between BFC Dynamo and Union Berlin was now such as heated affair that the matches were moved by the DFV to the neutral Stadion der Weltjugend in Mitte.[1004] It was considered that safety could not be guaranteed with the larger number of spectators.[1005][1006][719][762] The Stadion an der Alten Försterei was known for its atmosphere and the Stadion der Weltjugend was located only a few minutes away from the home district of BFC Dynamo.[990][66] The move was therefore seen as a major disadvantage by the fans to Union Berlin and further diluted their aversion to BFC Dynamo.[45][66][nb 22] Union Berlin defeated BFC Dynamo 1–0 in front of 45,000 spectators at the Stadion der Weltjugend in the first meeting of the 1976–77 season on 4 September 1976.[1008][294][95] Union Berlin also won the return match on 19 February 1977.[95] The two wins against BFC Dynamo during the 1976–77 season cemented the reputation of Union Berlin as a cult club and crowd puller.[1009]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo established itself as one of the top teams in the DDR-Oberliga from the mid-1970s. Union Berlin would come to play second fiddle in East Berlin from now on and never finish higher than seventh place in the DDR-Oberliga.[1010] In the shadow of BFC Dynamo, Union Berlin would no longer have any major sporting significance in East Germany.[1011] Union Berlin became a yo-yo team that hovered between the Oberliga and the DDR-Liga.[1010] Supporters of Union Berlin saw BFC Dynamo as the highest representative of the security organs and the police, with privileges in player recruitment and financial support as well as the political clout of Mielke.[762] This was supposedly in contrast to their own club, which they regarded as an underdog rooted in the working class.[762][719][1012][753] BFC Dynamo would be disliked all over East Germany for its successes and its connection to the Stasi.[910][137][38] This was also reflected in the derby between BFC Dynamo and Union Berlin.[137] The supporters of Union Berlin were seen as oppositional.[137] This is illustrated in the famous sentence of the editor-in-chief of the satirical magazine Eulenspiegel: \\\"Not all Union fans are enemies of the state, but all enemies of the state are Union fans.\\\"[137][1013] But the fact that people supported Union Berlin did not automatically mean that they were against the state.[177] Union Berlin got a lot of sympathy as the weaker club.[177][1014] There was a simple rule in East German football, where the least privileged club got the most sympathy.[178] Supporters of Union Berlin cultivated the image of their club as the eternal underdog.[762][1015]\\n\\nClashes between the supporters of the two teams became increasingly common in the 1970s. Union Berlin had one of the most notorious followings in East Germany at this time.[32] The supporters of Union Berlin often went to away matches in large numbers.[32] Fights were initially won by the supporters of Union Berlin. They were in the clear majority and could chase the supporters of BFC Dynamo from the streets.[972] A punch in the face and a stolen scarf was an experience for many young supporters of BFC Dynamo at this time.[990] But BFC Dynamo gained more and more young supporters with its growing successes in the late 1970s.[174] Many came from working-class families in Prenzlauer Berg.[749] The supporters of BFC Dynamo would eventually begin to appear extremely well organized and by the early 1980s they began to fight back.[972][32] The tide now turned and the supporters of BFC Dynamo would win all fights between the supporters of the two teams from now on.[972][990] Derbies at the Stadion der Weltjugend usually ended with a couple of hundred supporters of BFC Dynamo chasing the supporters of Union Berlin along Chausseestraße down towards the Friedrichsstrasse S-Bahn station.[1016][32][1017] The fights often continued on the side streets of Friedrichstraße.[1017]\\n\\nUnion Berlin is sometimes portrayed as having been an opponent of the East German system and derbies between BFC Dynamo and Union Berlin during the East German era have been hyped as some kind of domestic political showdown.[1018] But Union Berlin was mostly just a club struggling against unfavorable conditions.[1018] The club had become disadvantaged by the state sports politics compared to local rival BFC Dynamo.[1018] Honorary President of Union Berlin Günter Mielis has said: \\\"Union was not a club of resistance fighters, but we had to fight against a lot of political and economic resistance over and over again. We got strength from our fans\\\".[1019] However, Union Berlin would eventually become known for a supporter scene that was anti-establishment, where dissidents could vent their disdain for the system in the anonymity of a crowd.[1010] Supporters of Union Berlin also saw themselves as stubborn and non-conformist, but this image should not be confused with actual resistance.[38] Provocation was part of football in East Germany and people shouted out anything, because it was possible to get away with it.[1020] A critical attitude to the system was something that football supporters across East Germany had in common in the 1970s and 1980s.[1021]\\n\\nSupporters of Union Berlin from the East German era concede that it is an exaggeration to call the club a \\\"resistance club\\\".[1022][970] A supporter of Union Berlin has said: \\\"With the best of intentions, Union fans did not contribute to the overthrow of the GDR. No way, we were interested in football. There is the cliché about the club for the enemies of the state, but that wasn\'t us\\\".[1023] There were no political groups among the supporters of Union Berlin.[1024] For some supporters of Union Berlin, the dissident reputation of Union Berlin is a legend that was created after Die Wende.[1022] A controversy erupted around Union Berlin in 2011 when it became publicly known that the then President of Union Berlin Dirk Zingler had been a member of the Stasi Guards Regiment \\\"Felix E. Dzerzhinsky\\\" for three years during his military service between 1983 and 1986.[1025][1026] Zingler explained that he had sought to spend his military service in Berlin and claimed that he did not know beforehand that the regiment belonged to the Stasi.[1027] However, the Stasi Guards Regiment \\\"Felix E. Dzerzhinsky\\\" was an elite formation; it was not possible to simply apply for the regiment. The Stasi selected who it thought were best fit to serve with the regiment, only accepting recruits that were \\\"loyal to the line\\\".[1027][1028] Zingler had also been a member of the Socialist Unity Party (SED) and leader in the Free German Youth (FDJ) at the time.[1029][1028] Union Berlin Press spokesman Christian Arbeit commented on the reports about Zingler in 2011 saying: \\\"We do have a very unique history, compared to other clubs. But it wasn\'t us that always claimed we were this big anti-Stasi club. These are stories that get simplified in the media.\\\"[1026]\\n\\nMost supporters of Union Berlin were just normal football supporters.[1020] Politics was not in the foreground.[970] Supporters of Union Berlin from the era have testified that their support for the club had nothing to do with politics.[1030] The club was the most important thing and the identification with Union Berlin had primarily to do with Köpenick.[1030][1031] The rivalry was fueled by local pride from the supporters of the two teams.[1032] However, the political dimension was there nonetheless.[1010] BFC Dynamo was supported by the Stasi, who was disliked by many.[1010] But above all, it was the political instrumentalization of football that irritated supporters of Union Berlin.[1033] The political favoritism of BFC Dynamo greatly contributed to the enthusiasm of the supporters of Union Berlin.[972] Supporters of Union Berlin embraced the image of the underdog fighting the odds.[1004] An expression of the supporters of Union Berlin was: \\\"Better to be a loser than a stupid Stasi pig\\\".[1011]\\n\\nThe derby between BFC Dynamo and Union Berlin was first and foremost a local football derby.[1010] Both clubs had supporters who were not loyal to the line.[1024][1034][751] Also supporters of BFC Dynamo were observed by the Stasi during the 1980s.[1035] East Berlin was divided into two: BFC Dynamo was more strongly represented in some parts, and Union Berlin was more strongly represented in other parts.[972] Which team you supported was very much a question of where you lived.[32] BFC Dynamo was the local team if you grew up in Prenzlauer Berg.[1036] And you lived in Mitte, you were also more likely to be a supporter BFC Dynamo, as the home stadium was only a stone\'s throw away along Schönhauser Allee.[32] But Mitte was also a contested area.[759] The border allegedly ran at Alexanderplatz, where many fights between the supporters of the two teams were fought.[972][760] The home districts of the two clubs, Hohenschönhausen and Köpenick respectively, were always dangerous territory for supporters of the other team.[972]\\n\\n\\nBFC Dynamo midfielder Bernd Schulz (right) celebrating together with team captain Frank Rohde (left) after scoring a goal against 1. FC Union Berlin at the Stadion der Weltjugend on 18 March 1989.\\nBFC Dynamo and Union Berlin met a total of 35 times in the DDR-Oberliga and the FDGB-Pokal.

Thom, Frank Pastor and Christian Backs scored two goals each.[1039] The 1980s was a crushing win for BFC Dynamo. Former BFC Dynamo midfielder Falko Götz concluded that: \\\"Union was no opponent to us\\\".[1016] The two teams met 13 times in the Oberliga and FDGB-Pokal during the 1980s. BFC Dynamo won 11 matches and two matches ended in a draw. The matches between the two local rivals were hard-fought on the pitch.[294] Former BFC Dynamo midfielder Frank Terletzki has said that the victories against Union Berlin were always the best.[203] But despite the rivalry between the clubs, it happened that players hung out outside of football.[1040] Former BFC Dynamo defender Frank Rohde has said that players of BFC Dynamo and Union Berlin often gathered to have a beer together after matches.[294]\\n\\nThere were several transfers between the two clubs. BFC Dynamo recruited some of the best players of Union Berlin, such as Reinard Lauck in 1973, Detlef Helms in 1977 and Waldemar Ksienzyk in 1984.[45][970] But there were also transfers in the other direction. Union Berlin predecessor TSC Oberschöneweide recruited Ralf Quest from SC Dynamo Berlin in 1962. Quest scored the winning goal for Union Berlin in the final of the 1967-68 FDGB-Pokal, when the club won a sensational cup victory.[1041] Union Berlin would then recruit several players from BFC Dynamo over the years, such as Werner Heine in 1966, Werner Voigt, Bernd Kempke and Michael Jakob in 1973, Rainer Rohde in 1976, Rainer Wroblewski in 1977, Olaf Seier in 1983, Ralf Sträßer in 1984, Olaf Hirsch in 1986, Norbert Trieloff in 1987, Mario Maek in 1988, and Marco Kostmann and Thomas Grether in 1989, and Bernd Schulz in 1990.[95][970][294][1042] Union Berlin recruited a couple of players from BFC Dynamo in the 1980s who did some of their best seasons at the club.[1043][990] Olaf Seier became the team captain of Union Berlin and Ralf Sträßer became first and only player in Union Berlin to ever become league top goal scorer during the East German era.[65] Mario Maek saved Union Berlin from relegation with a late 3–2 goal against FC Karl-Marx-Stadt in the last match day of the 1987-88 DDR-Oberliga.[970][1044] As many as three former players of BFC Dynamo were involved in the winning goal for Union Berlin.[1044]\\n\\n\\nSupporters of FC Berlin during a match against 1. FC Union Berlin at the Stadion an der Alten Försterei on 23 September 1990.\\nUnion Berlin played in the DDR-Liga in the 1989–90 season. FC Berlin and Union Berlin met in the second round of the 1990-91 FDGB-Pokal at the Stadion an der Alten Försterei on 23 September 1990. It was the first match between the teams since the fall of the Berlin Wall. BFC Dynamo, now named FC Berlin, had now already lost many of its former top-performers to the West German Bundesliga.[1045][809] Union Berlin was now coached by the former BFC Dynamo player and youth coach Werner Voigt.[1046] Hooligans of FC Berlin stormed the home stands armed with clubs and flares and attacked supporters of Union Berlin at the beginning of the match.[263][809] Union Berlin won the match 2–1 on extra-time.[809] It was the first win for Union Berlin against FC Berlin since 1977.[263] Thomas Grether scored the first goal and Olaf Seier scored the winning goal for Union Berlin in the match. Both players had been brought up in the youth department of BFC Dynamo and had played matches for BFC Dynamo in the DDR-Oberliga.[809] Clashes between supporters of the two teams continued in the city after the match. Serious riots broke out in East Berlin, involving hundreds of supporters.[811]\\n\\nFC Berlin and Union Berlin then met in the promotion round to the 2. Bundesliga in the 1990–91 season. FC Berlin lost the first match 1–0 away in the second round at the Stadion an der Alten Försterei on 8 June 1991. Former BFC Dynamo player Bernd Schulz scored the winning goal for Union Berlin.[1047] FC Berlin then defeated Union Berlin 2–0 in the return match in fifth round in front of 9,475 spectators at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark on 18 June 1991. Heiko Bonan and Thorsten Boer scored one goal each in the match.[1048] FC Berlin was only one point behind leader BSG Stahl Brandenburg before the last round. The team managed to defeat Magdeburg 3–5 away on 23 June 1991. However, BSG Stahl Brandenburg defeated Union Berlin 2–0 away. FC Berlin thus finished in second place and missed promotion. Some supporters of BFC Dynamo are convinced that Union Berlin deliberately lost in order to prevent FC Berlin from advancing to the 2. Bundesliga.[257] FC Berlin and Union Berlin then also met in the promotion round for the 2. Bundesliga in 1991–92 season. FC Berlin won the first match 3–0 at home in the third round on 31 May 1992. The team then also won the return match 0–4 away in the fourth round on 7 June 1992.\\n\\nThe two teams met again in the new Regionalliga Nordost that was formed in 1994–95 season. Werner Voigt became the new coach of FC Berlin during the 1995–96 season. Voigt had a long history with BFC Dynamo but also had history with Union Berlin. Voigt had played for Union Berlin between 1973 and 1975 and had coached the team between 1990 and 1992.[1046] FC Berlin under coach Voigt lost 0–6 to 1. FC Union Berlin in the 1996–97 Regionalliga Nordost at the Stadion im Sportforum on 28 September 1996. It was the biggest defeat so far to Union Berlin.[294] Former FC Berlin player Thorsten Boer scored two goals for Union Berlin in the match.[1049] The two teams met 12 times in total in Regionalliga Nordost between 1994 and 2000.

The first match was played at the Stadion an der Alten Försterei on 21 August 2005. BFC Dynamo was missing striker Danny Kukulies and first-choice goalkeeper Nico Thomaschewski before the match. Kukulies was suspended and Thomaschewski injured.[1050][1051] German police and members of the SEK carried out a controversial raid against supporters of BFC Dynamo the night before the match.[440] Club management initially considered withdrawing from the match. The players voted on whether or not to play the match against Union Berlin.[865] More than 1,000 police officers were deployed to the match.[1016] BFC Dynamo eventually lost 8–0.[970] The return match was played at the Stadion im Sportforum on 13 May 2006. The score was 1–1 when around 200 supporters of BFC Dynamo stormed the pitch to attack supporters of Union Berlin.[456][871][873] Supporters of Union Berlin fled the guest block in panic.[872] The match was abandoned and Union Berlin was awarded a 2–0 victory.[871][873] The two teams has not met since then.\\n\\nBFC Dynamo met the reserve team of Union Berlin six times in the NOFV-Oberliga Nord and Regionalliga Nordost between 2010 and 2015.

Journalist Frank Willmann attended the match and claims that the number was rather 30. He also said he did not see any injured police.[1052] There have been several cases of violence between the supporters of the two teams during the 2010s.[1054] Around a hundred hooligans from Union Berlin tried to attack a senior tournament organized by BFC Dynamo in the Dynamo-Sporthalle on 30 January 2010.[1055][1056][1057][875] Also women and children got in the way of the attack.[1057] Around 30 partially masked supporters from Union Berlin attacked players and a small group of supporters of BFC Dynamo in connection with a senior match between Union Berlin and BFC Dynamo at the Sportanlage Hämmerlingstraße in Köpenick on 27 March 2015.[1058][45][1054] One player of BFC Dynamo and two guest spectators were injured.[45] A number of supporters of BFC Dynamo joined Hertha BSC in the guest block of the Stadion an der Alten Försterei during the derby between Union Berlin and Hertha BSC on 2 November 2019.[899]\\n\\nOrganization\\nCurrent board and management\\nAs of 1 August 2023[1059][1060][1061][1062][1063]\\nBerliner Fussball Club Dynamo e.

The U17 team competes in the third tier B-Junior Verbandsliga Berlin and the U19 team competes in second tier A-Junior Regionalliga Nordost.[1094] The youth teams are based in the Sportforum Hohenschönhausen.[637]\\n\\nThere were more than 800 children and youth players in the club as of 2019.[1095] Many children in the club comes from immigrant backgrounds or socially disadvantaged families.[637][1096][626][753][608][634] BFC Dynamo helped football club FC Berlin 23 from neighbouring Storkower Straße in September 2021 and saved more than 40 to 50 children from the club, which was about to be dissolved.[608]\\n\\nThe club launched the so-called \\\"Kita-projekt\\\" in 2003.[637] The Kita-projekt is a day care project that gives boys and girls aged 3 to 6 the opportunity to participate in sports on a regular basis.[637][1097] The Kita-projekt involved approximately 200 children from 16 day care centers in Berlin as of 2020.[1096] The majority of the children come from the localities or former boroughs of Lichtenberg, Hohenschönhausen, Karlshorst, Mitte, Weißensee and Pankow.[1097] The Kita-projekt was the first of its kind in Germany and has received several awards for its work with children.[637][1098][1099] The former professional player of BFC Dynamo Jörn Lenz is the head of the Kita-projekt as of 2021.[1099]\\n\\nThe so-called \\\"Jugendförderverein\\\" was founded in 2004.[426] It is a registered voluntary association that aims to promote youth sports at BFC Dynamo. The Jugendförderverein has supported youth teams with equipment, covered costs for trips to tournaments and helped youth trainers to be able to obtain their trainer license. The Jugendförderverein relies on donations and voluntary work.[1100] Former Club President Mario Weinkauf was one of the seven founding members of the Jugenförderverein and briefly served as chairman of the association before he became club president. Weinkauf had also been a youth trainer in the club for some time.[426]\\n\\nYouth academy during East German era\\nBFC Dynamo had a very successful youth academy during the East German era.[1016][174][201] The youth department had full-time trainers available for all youth classes and access to the best material conditions in the Dynamo-Sportforum.[105][1101] There were no less than 40 full-time trainers in the club.[928] Youth coaches were highly qualified and training in the Children and Youth Sports School (KJS) was extensive.[1102][1103] The youth work at BFC Dynamo during the East German era was described as \\\"absolutely leading\\\" by former coach Jürgen Bogs, who had a background as coach of the junior team.[105][1101] It was also described as \\\"exquisite\\\" by former German sports journalist Horst Friedemann, who worked for Deutsches Sportecho and Kicker.[201]\\n\\nThe upper tier of elite clubs in East Germany had privileged access to talents within designated geographical and administrative areas.[4][1104] All designated football clubs were assigned one or two regional districts in East Germany as catchment areas at their founding in 1965–1966. BFC Dynamo was initially assigned Bezirk Cottbus and one third of the districts in East Berlin.[35][65] The club was later allowed to take over the training centers (German: Trainingszentrum) (TZ) in East Berlin that had previously belonged to the catchment area of FC Vorwärts Berlin, when FC Vorwärts Berlin was relocated to Frankfurt an der Oder before the 1971-72 season.[64][65]\\n\\nHowever, BFC Dynamo, as well as FC Vorwärts Berlin and SG Dynamo Dresden, also had another structural advantage when it came to recruiting talents.[1105] Most sports associations (German: Sportvereinigung) (SV) were dissolved at the founding of the DTSB in 1957.[1106] However, sports associations SV Dynamo and ASV Vorwärts were allowed to continue exist.[1107] A decision in the SED Politburo in 1962 then stipulated that the sports associations SV Dynamo and ASV Vorwärts were allowed to set up sports communities in each location where they operated offices. This meant that SV Dynamo and ASV Vorwärts would be able to run sports communities across the country.[1108] BFC Dynamo would eventually be able recruit talents from the youth departments of all sports communities (German: Sportgemeinschaft) (SG) of SV Dynamo in East Germany, except those in Bezirk Dresden and a number of other sports communities in the southern regional districts that belonged to the catchment area of SG Dynamo Dresden.[105][4][1109][nb 39]\\n\\nThe basis of the East German selection and screening system in competitive sports would eventually consist of special training centers (TZ).[1113][1114][nb 40] SV Dynamo would operate numerous training centers across the whole of East Germany. The training centers were either assigned to BFC Dynamo or SG Dynamo Dresden, depending on catchment area. Training in these training centers were better than elsewhere. The work in the training centers was supervised and directed by BFC Dynamo. The best talents from the individual training centers were then brought together and selected in a multi-day screening session.[69] BFC Dynamo would come to benefit from a nationwide scouting network, which included the partnership with Bezirk Cottbus and 33 training centers (TZ) of SV Dynamo.[1118][1119][68] In total, BFC Dynamo had access to 38 training centers (TZ) across East Germany for the recruitment of talents. As a comparison, Union Berlin had only access to six training centers (TZ), all of which were located in the Berlin area.[70]\\n\\nA number of football clubs became specially promoted focus clubs in the 1970 DFV Football Resolution.[60][999] The focus clubs would receive additional financial support from the DTSB and other advantages.[998][996] In the 1976 DFV Football Resolution, focus clubs were also allowed delegate youth players from other football clubs.[1001] BFC Dynamo became the focus club in East Berlin. As a focus club, BFC Dynamo had the right to delegate 12 students to its affiliated Children and Youth Sports Schools (KJS) every year.[1109][1002] Non-focus football clubs only had the right to delegate six students to their affiliated Children and Youth Sports School (KJS) every year.[1002] The elite Children and Youth Sports School (KJS) \\\"Werner Seelenbinder\\\" provided boarding and schooling for talented players in the Sportforum.[1120][1121][1107] The Children and Youth Sports School (KJS) \\\"Werner Seelenbinder\\\" was affiliated to sports club SC Dynamo Berlin.[1122]\\n\\nThe success of BFC Dynamo during the East German era was based on the club\'s extensive youth work.[1123][1124][105][201] In 1975, there were as many as five national team players in the East Germany junior national football team among the club\'s youth players from the class of 1957.[98]1 Only a fifth of the players who won the ten East German championships with BFC Dynamo were older than 18 years when they joined the club.[990] The youth academy produced stars such as Lutz Eigendorf, Falko Götz and Andreas Thom.[1120][1016][1102][752] Most of the top performers of BFC Dynamo in the 1980s came through the club\'s own youth teams, including Frank Terletzki, Hans-Jürgen Riediger, Norbert Trieloff, Bodo Rudwaleit, Ralf Sträßer, Artur Ullrich, Rainer Ernst, Bernd Schulz, Christian Backs, Frank Rohde, Falko Götz, Jan Voß, Andreas Thom, Jörg Fügner, Hendrik Herzog and Marco Köller.[1125][1126][1127] Several former players of SC Dynamo Berlin and BFC Dynamo became youth trainers in the club after ending their playing careers, such as Herbert Schoen, Hermann Bley, Günter Schröter, Martin Skaba, Peter Rohde, Werner Voigt, Hartmut Pelka and Hans-Jürgen Riediger.[1128][1129][1125][1130][1131]\\n\\nNumerous players from East Germany joined West German clubs at the end of East Germany. Many came from BFC Dynamo. More than 110 players who had been trained in East Germany, primarily in a Children and Youth Sports School (KJS), would go on to play for West German or West Berlin clubs in the Bundesliga after the end of East Germany. German author Michael Peter has created a database for all players who had been trained in East Germany and who played for West German or West Berlin football clubs after 1990. For players born before 1976, BFC Dynamo was the biggest contributor. 98 players, born before 1976, came from the ten designated football clubs and SG Dynamo Dresden. 18 of these, came from BFC Dynamo.[1108]\\n\\nHonours\\nNext Generation Oberliga (German: Nachwuchsoberliga) (de)[a]\\nWinners: 1981, 1991[b]\\nRunners-up (6): 1979, 1983\\nEast German Junior Championship (de)[c]\\nWinners: (5) 1960,[d] 1978, 1979, 1987, 1991\\nRunners-up (6): 1967, 1974, 1976, 1977, 1988, 1989\\nEast German Youth Championship (Youth FDJ-Pokal) (de)[e]\\nWinners: (4) 1967, 1972, 1975, 1987\\nRunners-up: 1983, 1989\\nEast German Junior Cup (Junge Welt-Pokal) (de)[c]\\nWinners: (5) 1966, 1967, 1987, 1989, 1990[b] (record)\\nEast German Youth Cup (Youth FDGB-Pokal)[e]\\nWinners: (5) 1965,[d] 1968, 1971, 1972, 1976 (record)\\n Corresponds to U21 level. The league existed from 1976 to 1983 and 1989 to 1991. The reserve teams of the 14 DDR-Oberliga clubs were no longer allowed to participate in the DDR-Liga after the 1975-76 season. The Junior Oberliga (de) was also disbanded after the season. The Next Generation Oberliga was introduced instead. Youth teams of the 14 DDR-Oberliga clubs were all were eligible to start in the 1976-77 Next Generation Oberliga. Next Generation Oberliga was disbanded after the 1982-83 season. All teams were instead assigned to the third tier Bezirksliga. BFC Dynamo participted in the 1983-84 Bezirksliga Berlin with reseve team BFC Dynamo II. BFC Dynamo II won the 1983-84 Bezirksliga Berlin and qualified for the 1984-85 DDR-Liga A.\\n Won as FC Berlin.\\n Corresponds to U19 level.\\n Won by SC Dynamo Berlin.\\n Corresponds to U17 level.\\nExplanatory notes\\n This was not the first or last relocation or transfer of entire football teams in East Germany at the time. Sports association SV Deutsche Volkpolizei relocated its three second-tier teams SV Deutsche Volkspolizei Potsdam, SV Deutsche Volkspolizei Weimar and SV Deutsche Volkspolizei Schwerin to sports communities in larger cities during the summer of 1952. SV Deutsche Volkspolizei Potsdam was relocated to Berlin, SV Deutsche Volkspolizei Weimar to Erfurt and SV Deutsche Volkspolizei Schwerin to Rostock.[6]The team of SV Vorwärts der KVP Leipzig was relocated to East Berlin in 1953. The team continued the 1953-54 DDR-Oberliga as SV Vorwärts der KVP Berlin. SV Vorwärts der KVP Berlin then became ASK Vorwärts Berlin, which later became FC Vorwärts Berlin.[7][4] The relatively successful team of BSG Empor Lauter and its place in the DDR-Oberliga was transferred to sports club SC Empor Rostock in 1954. The football department of SC Empor Rostock later became F.C. Hansa Rostock.[8] The team of BSG Turbine Halle and its place in the DDR-Oberliga was transferred to sports club SC Chemie Halle-Leuna in 1954.[9] The football department of SC Chemie Halle-Leuna later became Hallescher FC Chemie.\\n SG Dynamo Dresden itself had a background that involved political interference and player delegations. SG Dynamo Dresden was previously known as SV Deutsche Volkspolizei Dresden. When SG Friedrichstadt was dissolved by East German sports authorities after the 1949–50 DDR-Oberliga, the playing right in the DDR-Oberliga was transferred to SV Deutsche Volkspolizei Dresden.[10][8][11] SV Deutsche Volkspolizei Dresden had previously played in the lower-tier Stadtliga Dresden and was thus able to enter the DDR-Oberliga without having to progress through divisions.[12][13] In order to keep the place in the DDR-Oberliga, the team of SV Deutsche Volkspolizei Dresden would be reinforced with players from Volkspolizei teams all over the country.[14] The head of the Volkspolizei Kurt Fischer ordered that best football players in the sports communities of the Volkspolizei around East Germany should be concentrated in the now first-tier SV Deutsche Volkspolizei Dresden.[15] The 40 best players of the various Volkspolizei teams in East Germany were then brought together for a training session in Forst in July 1950. Coaches Fritz Sack and Paul Döring then picked out 17 players from 11 different cities who were delegated to Dresden to form the team.[16][11] SV Deutsche Volkspolizei Potsdam lost its five best players and was severaly weakened.[13][17]\\n However, newspaper Neues Deutschland reported an attendance number of 60,000 spectators.[20]\\n BFC Dynamo played friendly matches against Pogoń Szczecin in 1966, 1969, 1973, two times in 1975, 1977, two times in 1978, 1980, 1984, 1985, 1986 and 1987.[43]\\n SV Dynamo would eventually operate numerous training centers (TZ) across East Germany. The training centers were divided between BFC Dynamo and SG Dynamo Dresden depending on catchment area.[69]\\n German author Steffen Karas also claims in his book \\\"66 Jahre BFC Dynamo - Auswärts mit \'nem Bus\\\" that BFC Dynamo actually only scored nine match-deciding goals in the 86th minute or later, in the 218 matches it won or drew during its ten championship years. Only one of those goals came from a penalty. That penalty was the controversial penalty against 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig in the 1985-86 DDR-Oberliga on 22 March 1986, which was later proven to be correct.[205]\\n Karin Halsch was known as Karin Seidel-Kalmutzki at the time.[339]\\n Sources vary on the history of the stadium. A few sources state that the stadium was constructed in 1954 and then refurbished in 1973.[685][693] A centrally located football stadium is depicted in the early plans for the Dynamo-Sportforum by architects Walter Schmidt and Heinz Scharlipp.[694] Other sources suggest that the stadium was completed in its current form in 1970.[695][688][696]\\n The capacity was 12,000 at the beginning of the 1966–67 season and 14,000 at the beginning of the 1968–69 season.[706][707]\\n The skinhead movement in East Germany grew out of the punk subculture, and was characterized as an aggressive form of protest.[777][778] It was radicalized in the middle of the 1980s, by a hybrid of ultranationalism, xenophobia and anti-communism.[778] East Berlin was the epicenter of the East German skinhead movement, with BFC Dynamo and 1. FC Union Berlin as its two football magnets.[778][779] The Stasi concluded that about 30-40 skinheads were associated to the two clubs in December 1985. Many were attached to fan cub Anale Berlin at BFC Dynamo.[778] Anale Berlin became infamous for its violence capital and glorification of fascism.[778][779] There were around 300–400 skinheads in East Berlin in December 1987.[780][717] Many were fans of BFC Dynamo.[717] Reports noted a group of roughly 100 skinheads that regularly attended the away matches of BFC Dynamo in 1988.[781] And the Stasi estimated that there were about 30 skinheads among the followers of 1. FC Union Berlin in July 1988.[4][781] Despite the fierce rivalry between BFC Dynamo and 1. FC Union Berlin, there were contacts between skinheads of the two clubs.[32] Far-right skinheads were attached to fan clubs Borussen and Die Löwen at 1. FC Union Berlin.[772][782]\\n However, hooligans of BFC Dynamo and skinheads allegedly attached to the hooligan scene of BFC Dynamo were also involved in serious incidents associated with racism and right wing-extremism in the 1980s. Hooligans of BFC Dynamo attacked 26 Cuban guest workers on train D 1056 towards Berlin-Lichtenberg, while returning from a match in Halle on 12 May 1984.[788][789] The hooligans had allegedly shouted racist slogans and sung the Deutschlandlied. At least nine Cubans were injured.[790] A number of skinheads allegedly attached to the hooligan scene of BFC Dynamo were also among those convicted for the much-publicized attack on a punk concert in the Zionskirche church in East Berlin on 17 October 1987.[178][137] However, incidents associated to racism and right-wing extremism in East German football were not isolated to BFC Dynamo and authorities also recorded the use of racists slogans, such as \\\"Jewish pigs!\\\", by supporters of several other teams at the time, including SG Dynamo Dresden and 1. FC Union Berlin.[791][792][793]\\n Several sources claim that a group of 500 hooligans of BFC Dynamo attacked a gas station, looted shops and attacked the Volkspolizei in Jena in November 1989.[32][799][459][788][798] One source specifically claims that the incidents occurred in connection to an away match in the DDR-Oberliga.[799] However, the sources do not specify any exact date or any details regarding which match the incidents occur in connection with. FC Berlin played away against FC Carl Zeiss Jena in the 18th matchday of the 1989-90 DDR-Oberliga on 8 April 1990.\\n Hooligans in Magdeburg attacked Soviet soldiers on 29 August 1990. One officer fired a warning shot.[803] The police fired warning shots during violent riots after the friendly match between 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig and FC Bayern Munich on 6 September 1990.[803][813][815] The match between FC Sachsen Leipzig and FC Carl Zeiss Jena in the 1990-91 NOFV-Oberliga on 29 September 1990 was abandoned shortly before the end due to violent riots in the stadium.[813][814]\\n However, the high number of supporters of FC Berlin at the scene claimed by the police has been disputed.[820] The number of supporters of FC Berlin on the scene varies between different sources. The police initially stated that they had faced up to 500 hooligans.[817][824] However, an eyewitness stated that the group that arrived at the S-Bahn station and marched towards the stadium rather consisted of only 150 supporters. This group was supposedly met by around 50 police officers outside the stadium.[820] Neues Deutschland reported that the number of rioters outside the stadium \\\"grew to around 400 to 500 hooligans\\\".[819] A common figure is that 400 supporters of FC Berlin arrived at the S-Bahn station after kick-off.[823][802][825][264] A supporter of FC Berlin has said in Zeit that there were almost 500 supporters of FC Berlin outside the stadium.[265]\\n Another legend tells that Erich Mielke made a remark about bringing the title to Berlin after the fractious encounter between Dynamo Dresden and BFC Dynamo on 2 December 1978, when he allegedly walked into the locker room of Dynamo Dresden and told the players that \\\"You must understand, the capital city needs a champion!\\\".[923] However, according to another version, he instead made this remark when the players of Dynamo Dresden celebrated their title in 1978 and he allegedly ghosted into their locker room to inform them that BFC Dynamo will be champions next year.[924] And according to yet another version, this happened instead after BFC Dynamo had won its second title in 1980, when Erich Mielke allegedly told the players of Dynamo Dresden that \\\"One must understand, the capital city needs a champion.\\\"[178] Dynamo Dresden was one point ahead of BFC Dynamo before the last match day of the 1979-80 DDR-Oberliga. BFC Dynamo met Dynamo Dresden home in the last matchday on 10 May 1980. BFC Dynamo won the match 1-0 and captured the league title. Dynamo Dresden player Udo Schmuck remembers how Mielke came into the locker room of Dynamo Dresden after the match with a gold medal around his neck. He allegedly said: \\\"It doesn\'t matter. The main thing is that Dynamo is champion!\\\".[925] Mielke is also said to have told Dynamo Dresden player Hans-Jürgen Dörner at the same occasion; \\\"Comrade Dörner, it is clear to all of you that the title belongs in the capital, now it\'s the turn of the BFC.\\\"[926]\\n Former SG Dynamo Dresden coach Klaus Sammer claimed in an interview with Berliner Zeitung in 2003 that with \\\"a few exceptions\\\", SG Dynamo Dresden was only able to fall back on the Bezirk Dresden as catchment area.[929] However, Bezirk Dresden was one of the most populous regional districts in East Germany. East German sports journalist Horst Friedemann claims that the SV Dynamo sports communities (SG) of Eisleben and Halle/Neustadt also belonged to the catchment area of SG Dynamo Dresden. They were located under the \\\"southern line\\\", where Dresden had access.[930] SG Dynamo Dresden also had access to training centers (TZ) of SV Dynamo. SV Dynamo operated numerous training centers across East Germany. The training centers were either assigned to BFC Dynamo or SG Dynamo Dresden, depending on catchment area.[931] In total, SG Dynamo Dresden had 35 partner associations (German: Partnervereine), including training centers (TZ). Their task was mainly to scout the best players and then send them to Dresden.[932] German sports historian Hanns Leske has categorized SG Dynamo Dresden as the third most privileged football club or sports community in East German football, behind FC Vorwärts Berlin and BFC Dynamo.[933]\\n Supporters of 1. FC Union Berlin used the same provocation at away matches in Saxony, despite their cultivation of their club\'s underdog image. A supporter of 1. FC Union Berlin has testified that they brought Cuban organges and rotten bananas to an away match against FC Karl-Marx-Stadt, fully aware that these fruits were symbols of their privileges as East Berliners.[962]\\n BFC Dynamo was officially a club of the Ministry of the Interior.[973] The official sponsor (German: Träger) of the club was the Volkspolizei.[36] The official sponsor of Union Berlin was the state-owned combine VVB Hochspannungsgeräte und Kabel.[974]\\n The football clubs had been assigned one or two districts in East Germany as catchment areas at their founding. 1. FC Union Berlin had been assigned Bezirk Potsdam and one third of all training centers (TZ) in East Berlin. BFC Dynamo had been assigned Bezirk Cottbus and one third of training centers (TZ) in East Berlin. BFC Dynamo now had access to Bezirk Cottbus and two thirds of all training centers (TZ) in East Berlin. 1. FC Union Berlin on the other hand had to make do with its training centers (TZ) in East Berlin.[35][970]\\n FC Vorwärts Berlin was initially a focus club in East Berlin.[1000] The only major club in East Berlin that was never appointed as focus club was 1. FC Union Berlin.[60] FC Vorwärts Berlin continued to be part of the group of focus clubs after its relocation to Frankfurt an der Oder.[1000]\\n Football clubs were given performance assignments from the DTSB that had to be fulfilled. The clubs then had to report on the fulfillment in two-year analyzes. Union Berlin had the objective in 1977-78 of producing four players who could be delegated to the focus club BFC Dynamo. Union Berlin explained that its downward trend in the youth area was due to the fact that the club had to delegate its two best players to the focus club every year and that the club could only rely on four districts in East Berlin for further selection.[978]\\n The club management of 1. FC Union Berlin seriously considered moving all matches to Stadion der Weltjugend after a stormy encounter with BSG Wismut Aue in 1976.[1007]\\n Manfred Kirste was the first president and is the longest serving president. He served as president from 15 January 1966 to 30 August 1988.\\n Served as president until 19 Februari 1990.[1064]\\n Became acting president after the dismissal of Herbert Krafft on 19 February 1990. Bogs served as acting president until 27 May 1990.[1064]\\n Dr. Klaus Janz served as president until 15 October 1990.[1065] He asked to be relieved from the office due to professional stress as a lawyer. He continued as vice president.[1066]\\n Dr. Wolfgang Hösrich became president on 15 October 1990. He had a background as a club doctor for SC Dynamo Berlin and BFC Dynamo. Hösrich had previously served as vice president.[1067][1066] The presidium under Dr. Wolfgang Hösrich was replaced by a new presidium under Eberhard Landmann on 20 May 1994.[1068][1069][1070]\\n Eberhard Landmann became president on 20 May 1994.[1071] Landmann was a former insurance salesman. He only served as president for nine months.[1068][1069][1072]\\n Klaus Bittroff was elected as the new president on 10 February 1995 with the votes 73-11. Volkmar Wanski was elected as one of two vice presidents alongside re-elected Lutz Hoff.[1073][1072][1071] Bittroff had previously served as president of Wacker 04 Berlin from 1984 to 1991.[1071]\\n Became new president after the resignation of Klaus Bittroff on 14 September 1995.[287] Wanski resigned on 29 June 2000.[335][1072][1074]\\n Sports director Hans Reker was appointed acting president by the Economic council following the resignation of Volkmar Wanski on 29 June 2000.[335][1074] Karin Halsch took office as new president on 27 September 2000.[339]\\n Karin Halsch was known as Karin Seidel-Kalmutzki during the era. Served from 27 September 2000 to 25 June 2001.[339][1075]\\n Sports director Hans Reker served as acting president following the resignation of Karin Halsch on 25 June 2001.[1075][356] Hans Reker held the position of vice president in the presidium of Karin Halsch.[1076][346] He resigned together with the entire presidium on 30 October 2001.[376] An emergency board formed by André Sommer, Rayk Bernt and press spokesman Holger Zimmermann took office. The emergency board was meant to serve until the extraordinary general meeting on 26 November 2001.[376][387]\\n An emergency board formed by André Sommer, Rayk Bernt and press spokesman Holger Zimmermann took office on 1 November 2001. No new president was appointed for the transitional board.[376][387] Zimmerman soon resigned on 23 November 2001.[653] A new presidium was due to be elected on the extraordinary general meeting on 26 November 2001. However, the meeting agenda was changed with the votes 87 to 59 at the insistence of the emergency board. The meeting was converted into an information event and new elections were postponed.[653][1077] Club members collected signatures for the election of a new presidium. But the signatures would be ignored by Sommer and Bernt.[388] The Sommer and Bernt presidium was finally overthrown by supporters and the former coach of the women\'s team Volkmar Lucius after an application to the Charlottenburg district court.[388][401] The Charlottenburg district court appointed Lucius as emergency board member.[388] A new presidium was elected on the extraordinary general meeting on 31 May 2002.[1078]\\n Elected on an extraordinary general meeting on 31 May 2002.[1078]\\n Mario Weinkauf was elected president on 18 June 2004.[426] He resigned on a meeting with the presidium on 22 June 2007. He was then dismissed in a vote of no-confidence on an extra-ordinary general meeting on 23 June 2007. Mario Weinkauf was succeeded by Volkmar Wanski as interim president. Volkmar Wanski had been co-opted into the presidium and elected as the provisional successor to Mario Weinkauf on the meeting with the presidium on 22 June 2007. However the interim presidency of Volkmar Wanski was controversial. It was put into question whether his election was compliant with club statutes. Volkmar Wanski resigned after only six days.[1079][1080][1081]\\n Frank Bertron was launched as interim president by the Economic Council under Peter Meyer.[487][1081] He was presented as new president on 28 June 2007.[1081]\\n Norbert Uhlig is the second longest serving president after Manfred Kirste. Norbert Uhlig has been president since 11 October 2008.[1082]\\n German sports historian Hanns Leske writes that BFC Dynamo was able to recruit young players from the youth departments of all sports communities (SG) of SV Dynamo in East Germany, except those in Bezirk Dresden.[1110] German author Anne Hahn writes that the training centers (TZ) of SV Dynamo across East Germany were divided between BFC Dynamo and SG Dynamo Dresden. She writes that the catchment area of BFC Dynamo included the SV Dynamo sports communities (SG) of Rostock-Mitte, Neustrelitz, Fürstenwalde, Schwerin and Berlin. The best talents were brought together in these training centers and then selected in a central, multi-day screening courses.[931] Also Horst Friedemann claims that the catchment area of BFC Dynamo included the SV Dynamo sports communities (SG) of Rostock-Mitte, Neustrelitz, Fürstenwalde and Schwerin. According to Friedemann, the SV Dynamo sports communities (SG) of Eisleben and Halle/Neustadt instead belonged to the catchment area of SG Dynamo Dresden. That was the \\\"southern line\\\", where Dresden had access.[1111][1112]\\n The training centers (TZ) were the first preparatory stage for the support of children found suitable for sports. Training in training centers usually started at the age of 10.[1115] The training course usually lasted for three to four years.[1115] From the training centers, the best young talents could then be delegated to a Children and Youth Sports School (KJS) and a Sports club (SC) or a Football club (FC).[1116][1113][1117]\\nReferences\\nTemplate:Reflist\\n\\nFurther reading\\nTemplate:Cite news\\nBertram, Marco (2015).

V., commonly abbreviated to BFC Dynamo (German pronunciation: [beːʔɛfˌt͡seː dyˈnaːmo] (listen)) or BFC (German pronunciation: [beːʔɛfˈt͡seː] (listen)), alternatively sometimes called Dynamo Berlin, is a German football club based in the locality of Alt-Hohenschönhausen of the borough of Lichtenberg of Berlin. BFC Dynamo was founded in 1966 from the football department of SC Dynamo Berlin and became one of the most successful clubs in East German football. The club is the record champion of East Germany with ten consecutive league championships from 1979 through 1988. BFC Dynamo competes in the fourth tier Regionalliga Nordost. The club enjoys a cross-city rivalry with 1. FC Union Berlin and a historical rivalry with SG Dynamo Dresden. The rivalry with Union Berlin is part of the Berlin derby.\\n\\nHistory\\nBackgrund, founding and rise (1954–1978)\\nMain article: History of Berliner FC Dynamo (1954–1978)\\nBackground: SC Dynamo Berlin (1954–1966)\\nBFC Dynamo started as a football department of sports club SC Dynamo Berlin. SC Dynamo Berlin was founded on 1 October 1954 as one of the new elite sports clubs in East Germany.[2] The sports club was affiliated to sport association SV Dynamo. In order to establish a competitive side in Berlin, the team of SG Dynamo Dresden and its place in the DDR-Oberliga was transferred to the new sports club SC Dynamo Berlin. The relocation was designed to give the capital a team that would rival teams from West Berlin such as Hertha BSC, which were still popular in East Berlin.[3][4][5][nb 1][nb 2]\\n\\n\\nGünter Schröter (left), Horst Kohle of ASK Vorwärts Berlin (centre) and Martin Skaba (right) during a match between Vorwärts Berlin and Dynamo Berlin at the Walther-Ulbricht-Stadion on 18 October 1959\\nThe team played its first match as SC Dynamo Berlin against BSG Rotation Babelsberg in the 1954-55 DDR-Oberliga on 21 November 1954. Among the players delegated from SG Dynamo Dresden were Johannes Matzen, Herbert Schoen and Günter Schröter. SC Dynamo Berlin finished its first season in the DDR-Oberliga in seventh place. The team was relatively successful in the 1955 DDR-Oberliga, but suffered relegation to the second tier DDR-Liga after the 1956 DDR-Oberliga. SC Dynamo Berlin played a friendly match against Polish side Górniczy KS Szombierki Bytom in front of 80,000 spectators at the Walter-Ulricht-Stadion on 9 May 1957.[18][19] The attendance number is allegedly the highest in the history of the club.[19][nb 3] SC Dynamo Berlin eventually finished the 1957 DDR-Liga in first place immediately returned to the DDR-Oberliga.\\n\\nGünter Schröter and Herbert Maschke would remain central players to the team into early the 1960s. But most other players of the former SG Dynamo Dresden team were no longer active in the team by the late 1950s.[21] Herbert Schoen had played his last competitive matches for the team during the 1957 season and Johannes Matzen had suffered a serious injury during the 1958 season and consequently had to end his playing career.[22] The team was now instead shaped by a new generation of players, including Martin Skaba, Werner Heine, Waldemar Mühlbächer, Hermann Bley and Konrad Dorner (de).[23]\\n\\n\\nThe team of SC Dynamo Berlin after winning the 1959 FDGB-Pokal, at the Bruno-Plache-Stadion in Leipzig on 13 December 1959\\nSC Dynamo Berlin had difficulties establishing itself in football in East Berlin.[17] The team rarely drawing crowds larger than 5,000 spectators at the Walter-Ulbricht-Stadion. SC Dynamo Berlin finally won its first trophy in the 1959 FDGB-Pokal. However, the team would not be allowed to participate in the 1960-61 European Cup Winners\' Cup. The East German Football Association (DFV) found local rival and league runner-up ASK Vorwärts Berlin to be a more suitable representative of East Germany in the competition.[24]\\n\\nSC Dynamo Berlin also had some success in the first seasons of the 1960s. The team fished the 1960 DDR-Oberliga as runner-up. SC Dynamo Berlin was a top team also in the 1961-62 DDR-Oberliga. The team participated in the 1961–62 International Football Cup during the summer of 1961. SC Dynamo Berlin was successful in 1961-62 FDGB-Pokal. The team was only defeated 1-3 by SC Chemie Halle in the final.[25] However, SC Dynamo Berlin still found itself overshadowed in the capital by the army-sponsored ASK Vorwärts Berlin.[26] The team of SC Dynamo Berlin during the 1960s would eventually prove relatively weak.[27] SC Dynamo Berlin had become a lower table side by the end of the 1962–63 Oberliga.[21]\\n\\nEast German football was reformed in 1965–66, when the football departments of ten sports clubs (SC) were made independent from their sports clubs to form ten dedicated football clubs. The new designated football clubs (FC) would form the elite of East German football. As part of the reorganization, the football section of SC Dynamo Berlin was separated from the sports club and reorganized as football club BFC Dynamo.[28][29][4][30] The football department of sports community SG Dynamo Hohenschönhausen was also disbanded after the 1965–66 season. The players of SG Dynamo Hochenschönhausen joined the reserve team BFC Dynamo II and BFC Dynamo II took over the place of SG Dynamo Hohenschönhausen in the 1966-67 Bezirksliga Berlin.\\n\\nFounding and second relegation (1966–1967)\\nBFC Dynamo was founded on 15 January 1966.[31] The new club was presented by the President of SV Dynamo Erich Mielke at a ceremony in the Dynamo-Sporthalle in Hohenschönhausen in East Berlin.[32] The first presidium included the Head of the Volkspolizei in East Berlin Horst Ende, the Intendant of the Metropol theatre Hans Pitra, former DDR-Oberliga player Johannes Matzen and the Editor-in-chief of the East German football weekly Die Neue Fußballwoche (FuWo) (de) Klaus Schlegel.[33] Manfred Kirste was elected club president and Mielke was elected honorary president.[32][31] Kirste came from Berlin and was a certified sports teacher.[34]\\n\\n\\nThe match between BFC Dynamo and FC Vorwärts Berlin in the DDR-Oberliga at the Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum on 13 August 1966\\nThe new designated football clubs (FC) were formed as centers of excellence in East German football, with the right to draw on talents within designated geographical and administrative areas.[4][29] BFC Dynamo was initiallly assigned Bezirk Cottbus and one third of East Berlin as catchment area.[35] BFC Dynamo was officially a club of the Ministry of the Interior, and the club\'s official sponsor was the Volkspolizei.[36][37] However, the honorary chairman Mielke was the head of the Stasi and most of the club\'s sponsoring members would eventually be made up of Stasi employees. BFC Dynamo would come to receive personal, organizational and financial support from the Stasi.[37][38] Research by the Stasi Records Agency has shown that 31 employees of the Ministry of the Interior and ten employees of the Stasi would eventually be involved in the club.[39]\\n\\nSC Dynamo Berlin had been in first place in the 1965-66 DDR-Oberliga after the eighth matchday.[40] BFC Dynamo were still in a good fourth place after a 2–0 win over BSG Chemie Leipzig on the 23rd matchday on 16 April 1966. However, the team then lost its last three matches in the league, against F.C. Hansa Rostock, SG Dynamo Dresden and FC Rot-Weiß Erfurt, and finished the season in ninth place.[41]\\n\\nHungarian Bela Volentik was new coach for the 1966–67 season. The team played a friendly match against Polish side Pogoń Szczecin on 10 September 1966. The match would be one of many in a long series of friendly maches against Pogoń Szczecin during the East German era.[42][nb 4] The team struggled in the 1966-67 DDR-Oberliga. BFC Dynamo faced local rivals 1. FC Union Berlin away on the 22nd matchday on 26 April 1967. BFC Dynamo was in 13th place in the league and threatened with relegation.[44][45] Supporters of 1. FC Union Berlin mocked the team with a banner saying \\\"We greet the relegated\\\". 1. FC Union Berlin won the match 3-0 and BFC Dynamo was now practically relegated.[45] The match is seen as the starting point for the feud between the two clubs.[45] BFC Dynamo eventually finished the 1966-67 DDR-Oberliga in 13th place and was again relegated to the DDR-Liga. Long-time player Waldemar Mühlbächer retired from his playing career after the season.[46] Mühlbächer had joined SC Dynamo Berlin in 1956 and had played 11 seasons for the team.[47]\\n\\nRejuvenation and first UEFA competition (1967–1972)\\nFormer SC Dynamo Berlin forward Karl Schäffner returned as coach for the 1967–68 season.[48] BFC Dynamo dominated the 1967-68 DDR-Liga Nord. The team was undefeated during the second half of the league season and immediately won promotion back to the DDR-Oberliga.[49] Forward Peter Lyszczan became tied league top goalscorer in the 1967-68 DDR-Liga Nord with 19 goals.[50] Martin Skaba and Hermann Bley retired after the 1967–68 season and Konrad Dorner was transferred to the reserve team BFC Dynamo II.[51] The three had joined SC Dynamo Berlin between 1956 and 1958. Skaba had played in a total of 343 matches for the team.[52]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo began a rejuvenation of the team during the 1967–68 season.[51] Among the players from the youth department who got to play matches in the 1967-68 DDR-Liga Nord were Harald Schütze (de), Norbert Johannsen and Werner Voigt.[53] BFC Dynamo fielded a young team in the 1968–69 season. The average age of the team was 23 years at the start of the season.[54] Harald Schütze was now a regular player in the team.[51] BFC Dynamo got off to a difficult start on its return to the DDR-Oberliga. Hans Geitel took over as coach for the second half of the season. Geitel had previously worked in the youth academy of BFC Dynamo.[55] The team finished the 1968-69 DDR-Oberliga in tenth place.\\n\\nBFC Dynamo recruited young forward Ralf Schulenberg from FC Rot-Weiß Erfurt for the 1969–70 season.[56] Schulenberg was probably compensation for the talented Günter Wolff, who had left BFC Dynamo for FC Rot-Weiß Erfurt after the 1967–68 season.[55] A number of players from the youth departments would also make their debut in the DDR-Oberliga in the following seasons, such as Peter Rohde (de) in 1969, Frank Terletzki in 1969 and Bernd Brillat in 1970. BFC Dynamo reached the final of the 1970-71 FDGB-Pokal. The team lost the final 1–2 in overtime to SG Dynamo Dresden, but qualified for the next season\'s UEFA Cup Winners\' Cup as runner-up.[57] This time, the team would also be allowed to participate in the competition, unlike in 1960. BFC Dynamo was thus finally ready for its first participation in an UEFA competition.[58]\\n\\nA number of football clubs became specially promoted focus clubs (German: Schwerpunktclubs) in the 1970 DFV Football Resolution (German: DFV-Fußballbeschluss).[59][60] BFC Dynamo and FC Vorwärts Berlin became focus clubs in East Berlin.[60][61] The football landscape in East Berlin would then change dramatically ahead of the 1971–72 season, when the Ministry of Defense decided to relocate FC Vortwärts Berlin to Frankfurt an der Oder.[62][63] BFC Dynamo and 1. FC Union Berlin were from now on the only major football clubs in East Berlin.[64] BFC Dynamo would be allowed to take over the catchment area in East Berlin that had previously belonged to FC Vorwärts Berlin.[65][64] The team would also have the opportunity to play more matches at the larger and more centrally located Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark in Prenzlauer Berg, which led to increased interest in the club and growing attendance numbers.[66]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo stood out among other teams within SV Dynamo. BFC Dynamo was located at the frontline of the Cold War. It was also a representative of the East German capital. This meant that the club had to be well equipped.[67] BFC Dynamo would eventually get access to a nationwide scouting network, including numerous training centers (German: Trainingszentrum) (TZ) of SV Dynamo across East Germany.[68][nb 5] BFC Dynamo would eventually be able to recruit young talented players from 38 training centers (TZ) across East Germany. By comparison, 1. FC Union Berlin only had access to 6 training centers (TZ), all of which were located in the Berlin area.[70]\\n\\nThe team was joined by forward Wolf-Rüdiger Netz from SG Dynamo Schwerin for the 1971–72 season. Among the central players in the team in the 1971–72 season were Werner Lihsa, Harald Schütze, Frank Terletzki, Dieter Stumpf, Norbert Johannsen, Peter Rohde, Wilfried Trümpler, Joachen Carow, Wolf-Rüdiger Netz and Ralf Schulenberg.[71] BFC Dynamo had success in the 1971–72 UEFA Cup Winners\' Cup. The team eliminated Cardiff City F.C. in the first round and then K Beerschot VA in the second round. BFC Dynamo would now also show its strength in the DDR-Oberliga. The team was unbeaten in the first six league matches after the winter break, including wins against top teams 1. FC Magdeburg and SG Dynamo Dresden.[72] The team eliminated Åtvidabergs FF in the quarter-finals of the 1971–72 UEFA Cup Winners\' Cup and advanced to the semi-finals.[73] BFC Dynamo thus became the first team from Berlin to reach the semi-finals in one of the two most prestigious UEFA competitions (the European Cup and the European Cup Winners\' Cup). BFC Dynamo was eventually eliminated by Dynamo Moscow in the semi-finals after a penalty shoot-out at the Druzhba Stadium in Lviv in the return leg on 20 April 1972.[74] The team finished the 1971-72 DDR-Oberliga as runner-up.\\n\\nRise in the DDR-Oberliga (1972–1978)\\nBFC Dynamo was qualified for the 1972-73 UEFA Cup. The team eliminated Angers SCO and Levski Sofia in the first two rounds. BFC Dynamo was then set to play Liverpool F.C. in the third round. The first leg ended 0–0 in front of 20,000 spectators at the Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum on 29 November 1972.[75] The team was eventually eliminated after a 1–3 defeat at Anfield on 13 December 1972. BFC Dynamo saw a decline in the league and finished 1972-73 DDR-Oberliga in sixth place. The talented 17-year-old forward Hans-Jürgen Riediger from the youth department made his debut for BFC Dynamo in the DDR-Oberliga at the end of the 1972–73 season.[76]\\n\\n\\nThe match between BFC Dynamo and F.C. Hansa Rostock at the Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum on 28 September 1974.\\nHarry Nippert became the new coach for the 1973–74 season.[77] Günter Schröter became his assistant.[78] Nippert had once played for SC Dynamo Berlin.[79] He had recently served as assistant to famous SG Dynamo Dresden coach Walter Fritzsch from 1969 to 1973.[80] BFC Dynamo recruited attacking midfielder and national team player Reinhard Lauck from relegated 1. FC Union Berlin for of the 1973–74 season.[78] Numerous players were tried during the season. Not a single player played all 26 league matches during the 1973–74 season.[81] The team finished also the 1973-74 DDR-Oberliga in sixth place. Martin Skaba became the new assistant coach for the 1974–75 season.[82] BFC Dynamo recruited young defender Michael Noack (de) from relegated BSG Energie Cottbus for the season.[82] League results improved and BFC Dynamo finished the 1974-75 DDR-Oberliga in fourth place. Several players from the youth department made their debuts for BFC Dynamo in DDR-Oberliga during the 1974–75 season: Lutz Eigendorf, Roland Jüngling (de) and Norbert Trieloff.[83][84][85]\\n\\n\\nHans-Jürgen Riediger in the match between BFC Dynamo and 1. FC Magdeburg at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark on 6 March 1976.\\nBFC Dynamo moved is home matches to the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark for the 1975–76 season.[86] Frank Terletzki became the new team captain for the season.[83] BFC Dynamo had the youngest team in the league in the 1975-76 DDR-Oberliga, with an average age of only 22.5 years.[87][83] BFC Dynamo was now again on the rise in the DDR-Oberliga. The team would eventually establish itself as a top team in the DDR-Oberliga in the mid-1970s. BFC Dynamo recorded several big wins and attendance numbers at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark in the 1975-76 DDR-Oberliga, such as 4–0 against second-placed 1. FC Magdeburg in front of 22,000 spectators on 6 March 1976, 3–0 against FC Carl Zeiss Jena in front of 23,000 spectators on 14 April 1976 and then 6–0 against third-placed 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig in front of 25,000 spectators on 8 May 1976.[88][89][90][91][92] The team finished the 1975-76 DDR-Oberliga as runner-up. The young team under Nippert achieved a goal difference of 67–24 in the 1975-76 DDR-Oberliga.[17]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo recruited young defender Rainer Troppa from relegated BSG Energie Cottbus for the 1976–77 season.[93] The team lost 0–1 to local rivals 1. FC Union Berlin in the opening match of the 1976-77 DDR-Oberliga in front of 45,000 spectators at the Stadion der Weltjugend on 4 September 1976.[94][95] BFC Dynamo was qualified for the 1976–77 UEFA Cup. The team was eliminated in the first round by Shakhtar Donetsk. Goalkeeper Bodo Rudwaleit and forward Ralf Sträßer from the youth department made their debuts for BFC Dynamo in the DDR-Oberliga during the first half of the 1976–77 season.[96][97] The return match against 1. FC Union Berlin in the 1976-77 DDR-Oberliga was played on 19 February 1977. The return match saw Peter Rohde play against his younger brother Rainer Rohde. Rainer Rohde, a former BFC Dynamo player for ten years, had been transferred to 1. FC Union Berlin in 1976. Their younger brother Frank Rohde, a youth player at BFC Dynamo, was one of the 28,000 spectators at the Stadion der Weltjugend. BFC Dynamo lost also the return match 0–1. However, the loss in the return match in the 1976-77 DDR-Oberliga would be the last ever defeat against 1. FC Union Berlin in the DDR-Oberliga.[95] BFC Dynamo came back with a 6–0 win over F.C. Hansa Rostock on the following matchday on 26 February 1977. Wolf-Rüdiger Netz scored a legendary hat-trick in the match, with three goals in the 63rd, 64th and 66th match minutes.[98]\\n\\n30-year-old Jürgen Bogs became the new coach for the 1977–78 season.[99][100][101] Bogs had a background as a youth coach in the club.

The team made it all the way to the quarter-finals of the 1979–80 European Cup, where it faced Nottingham Forest under Brian Clough. The team won the first leg 0–1 away. BFC Dynamo thus became the first German team to defeat an English team in England in the European Cup.[121] The winning goal was scored by Hans-Jürgen Riediger. However, the team lost the return leg 0-2 and was eliminated on goal difference. BFC Dynamo was one point behind leading SG Dynamo Dresden heading into the final matchday of the 1979-80 DDR-Oberliga.[122] The team defeated SG Dynamo Dresden 1–0 in the final matchday in front of 30,000 spectators at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark and won its second consecutive league title. The winning goal was scored by Norbert Trieloff.[123][124]\\n\\nThe East Germany national football team won silver medal at the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow. BFC Dynamo was represented by five players in the squad: Bodo Rudwaleit, Artur Ullrich, Norbert Trieloff, Frank Terletzki and Wolf-Rüdiger Netz. All five played in the final against Czechoslovakia at the Central Lenin Stadion on 2 August 1980.[125] Joachim Hall (de) became the new assistant coach for the 1980–81 season.[126] Hall had played for SC Dynamo Berlin and BFC Dynamo between 1963 and 1972. Also the 1980-81 DDR-Oberliga was a tight race. BFC Dynamo was in first place heading into the final matchday, with the same number of points as second-placed FC Carl Zeiss Jena.[127] BFC Dynamo defeated FC Carl Zeiss Jena 2–1 in the final match day and won its third consecutive league title.[128] Even more players from the youth department had been integrated into the first team over the last seasons, such as Rainer Ernst in 1979, Bernd Schulz in 1979, Olaf Seier in 1979, Frank Rohde in 1980, Falko Götz in 1980 and Christian Backs in 1981.\\n\\nBFC Dynamo was drawn against AS Saint-Étienne in the first round of the 1981-82 European Cup.

FC Magdeburg 4–0 on the 23rd matchday of the 1981-82 DDR-Oberliga in front of 18,000 spectators at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark on 8 May 1982.[133] Supporters of BFC Dynamo invaded the pitch of the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark in celebration of the league title. It was the first pitch invasion by the supporters of BFC Dynamo in the DDR-Oberliga.[134]\\n\\nDominance in the DDR-Oberliga (1982–1986)\\n\\nHans-Jürgen Riediger and defending Holger Hieronymus of Hamburger SV in the 1982-83 European Cup at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark on 15 September 1982.\\nBFC Dynamo was drawn against West German champions Hamburger SV in the first round of the 1982-83 European Cup. The Stasi feated riots, political demonstrations and supporters who might express sympathy for West German stars such as Felix Magath. Only 2,000 tickets were allowed for ordinary fans. The rest was instead allocated to a politically hand-picked audience.[135][136][137] The first leg ended 1–1 in front of 22,000 spectators at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark. Hans-Jürgen Riedier scored the only goal for BFC Dynamo in the match. BFC Dynamo was eventually eliminated after a 2–0 defeat at the Volksparkstadion in the return leg. BFC Dynamo now dominated the DDR-Oberliga. The team went through the entire 1982-83 DDR-Oberliga undefeated. BFC Dynamo was eventually defeated 1-2 by FC Karl-Marx-Stadt on the seventh matchday of the 1983-84 DDR-Oberliga on 1 October 1983. It was the first loss since the 22nd matchday of the 1981-82 DDR-Oberliga. BFC Dynamo had thus been undefeated in 36 matches in the league, which set a new record in the DDR-Oberliga for the longest unbeaten run.[138][139]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo was drawn against FK Partizan Belgrade in the second round of the 1983-84 European Cup. The team won the first leg 2–0 at home. The team flew to Belgrade with Erich Mielke\'s service aeroplane on 1 November 1983 for the return leg.[140] During a shopping trip in Belgrade the day before the match, players Falko Götz and Dirk Schlegel (de) defected to West Germany.[140][141] The talented 18-year old forward Andreas Thom from the youth department was given the chance to make his international debut in the match as a replacement for Falko Götz. Thom had only played 5 minutes in the DDR-Oberliga before that.[142] Thom made a terrific international debut and would henceforth be a regular player in the team.[141][143][144] The match ended 1-1 and BFC Dynamo advanced to the quarter-finals. BFC Dynamo was drawn against AS Roma in the quarter-finals of the 1983-84 European Cup.

It was the fourth time in five seasons that BFC Dynamo had been eliminated in the European Cup by an eventual finalist. Three times had BFC Dynamo been eliminated by the team that eventually won the tournament: Nottingham Forrest in the 1979-80 season, Aston Villa in the 1981-82 season and Hamburger SV in the 1982-83 season.\\n\\nBFC Dynamo capured its sixth consecutive league title on the 25th matchday of the 1983-84 DDR-Oberliga.[147] Rainer Ernst became the best goal scorer in the 1983-48 DDR-Oberliga with 20 goals.[148] Several players from the youth department made their debuts for BFC Dynamo in the DDR-Oberliga during the 1983–84 season, such as Andreas Thom, Thomas Grether, Mario Maek and Eike Küttner.[149] BFC Dynamo reached the final of the 1983-84 FDGB-Pokal. The team once again faced SG Dynamo Dresden in the final. BFC Dynamo lost the final 1–2.[150] Hans-Jürgen Riediger and Michael Noack ended their careers due to prolonged injuries after the season. Wolf-Rüdiger Netz retired and Ralf Sträßer left for 1. FC Union Berlin.[151] Riediger, Noack and Netz had all played around 200 matches each for BFC Dynamo in the DDR-Oberliga.[152][153][154] Riediger and Netz had also scored more than 100 goals each for BFC Dynamo in the DDR-Oberliga.[153][154]\\n\\n\\nThe team of BFC Dynamo celebrating its seventh consecutive DDR-Oberliga title at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark on 1 June 1985.\\nBFC Dynamo recruited striker Frank Pastor from relegated HFC Chemie and defender Waldemar Ksienzyk from relegated 1.

Goalkeeper Bodo Rudwaleit saved the last two penalty kicks for Aberdeen FC.[158][159][157] BFC Dynamo was neck-to-neck with SG Dynamo Dresden in the first half of the 1984-85 DDR-Oberliga. BFC Dynamo eventually finished the 1984-85 DDR-Oberliga in first place, six points ahead of SG Dynamo Dresden, and won its seventh consecutive league title. The team had scored a total of 90 goals during the league season, which set a new record for the number of goals in one DDR-Oberliga season.[160] No team would ever score more goals in one season in the DDR-Oberliga. Rainer Ernst was once again the best goal scorer in the league with 24 goals. Frank Pastor was the second best goal scorer in the league with 22 goals.[161] BFC Dynamo reached the final of the FDGB-Pokal for a second consecutive season and once again faced rival SG Dynamo Dresden in the final. BFC Dynamo lost the final of the 1984-85 FDGB-Pokal 2–3.[162]\\n\\n\\nThe match between 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig and BFC Dynamo on 22 March 1986.\\nBFC Dynamo was already eliminated in the first round of the 1985-86 European Cup by Austria Wien. The team faced stiff competition from SG Dynamo Dresden during the first half of the 1985-86 DDR-Oberliga. Youg defender Jörg Fügner from the youth departent made his debut for BFC Dynamo in the DDR-Oberliga towards the end of the first half of the season.[163] BFC Dynamo was in first place in the league before the winter break.[164] The team faced fourth-placed 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig on the 18th matchday. 1. FC Lokomotiv Leipzig led the match 1–0 in overtime. BFC Dynamo was then awarded a penalty in the 94th minute.[165] Frank Pastor safely converted the penalty and the match ended in a 1–1 draw.[166] The penalty was highly controversial and would later become known as the \\\"Shame penalty of Leipzig\\\".[167] BFC Dynamo also faced 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig in the two-legged semi-finals of the 1985-86 FDGB-Pokal. BFC Dynamo was eliminated on the away goals rule. 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig had scored a total of three goals on penalties in the semi-finals.[168][169] BFC Dynamo managed to secure its eighth consecutive league title on the final matchday of the 1985-86 DDR-Oberliga.[170][171] The team finished just two points ahead of runners-up 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig. Long time-player Frank Terletzki retired from his playing career after the season. Terletzki had played in a total of 489 matches for BFC Dynamo since 1969.[172]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo had the best material conditions in the league and the best team by far.[173] But controversial refereeing decisions in favor of BFC Dynamo gave rise to speculation that the dominance of BFC Dynamo was not solely due to athletic performance, but also due to help from referees.[174] BFC Dynamo was a representative of both the Stasi and the capital. The team was therefore viewed with more suspicion than affection.[175][174] The overbearing success of BFC Dynamo in the 1980s made fans of opposing teams easily aroused as to what they saw as manipulation by bent referees.[173][176] The team was met with aggression and shouts such as \\\"Bent champions!\\\" (German: Schiebermeister) and \\\"Jews Berlin!\\\" at away matches.[177][4][178][179] Complaints of alleged referee bias accumulated.[173][4][180] The German Football Association of the GDR (DFV) eventually conducted a secret review of the 1984-85 DDR-Oberliga.[173][167][181] Among other things, the review found that BFC Dynamo had earned only one third of the yellow cards incurred by rival SG Dynamo Dresden.[182][183][181] A review was also made of the final of the 1984-85 FDGB-Pokal final between BFC Dynamo and SG Dynamo Dresden. This review found that 30 percent of the referee decisions were wrong, and that 80 percent of those had been of disadvantage to SG Dynamo Dresden.[184][185][186][181] A number of referees were sanctioned for their performances in matches involving BFC Dynamo in the following months, including the referees involved in the cup final.[4][186][181]\\n\\nA particularly controversial episode was the penalty awarded to BFC Dynamo by referee Bernd Stumpf in extra time in the match between 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig and BFC Dynamo on 22 March 1986. The penalty caused a wave of protests.[167][187][174] SED General Secretary Erich Honecker and Secretary for Security, Youth and Sport of the SED Central Committee Egon Krenz were fed up with the \\\"football question\\\" and the \\\"BFC-discussion\\\".[167] An example was consequently made out of referee Stumpf. He was permanently banned from refereeing by the DFV.[165] The sanctions against Stumpf were approved by Honecker and Krenz in the SED Central Committee.[188][189] However, a previously unknown video recording of the match was published by Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk (MDR) in 2000. The video recording showed that the penalty was correctly awarded and that the sanctions against Stumpf were unjustified.[165][178][190]\\n\\n\\\"I can imagine there was referee manipulation due to the immense pressure from the government and Ministry for State Security. That could have made some referees nervous and influenced their decisions. But we were the strongest team at the time. We didn\'t need their help.\\\"\\n\\nFalko Götz[191]\\nThe benefit of controlling important matches in Western Europe might have put indirect pressure on the referees to take preventive measures, in so-called preventive obedience.[192][193][194][195][175] In order pursue an international career, a referee would need a travel permit, confirmed by the Stasi.[188][181][196] It become known after the German reunification that several referees had also been Unofficial collaborators (IM) of the Stasi.[167][197][198][199] However, there is no evidence to show that referees were under direct instructions from the Stasi and no document has ever been found in the archives that gave the Stasi a mandate to bribe referees.[197][194][200][201]\\n\\nThe picture that the success of BFC Dynamo relied upon referee bias is dismissed by former BFC Dynamo players and coaches. Some of them admit that there might have been cases of referee bias, but they all insist that it was the thoroughness of their youth work and the quality of their play that earned them their titles.[202][174][191][203] Former coach Jürgen Bogs has said: \\\"You cannot postpone 26 matches in one season in the DDR-Oberliga. At that time we had the best football team\\\".[204][190][nb 6] BFC Dynamo was able to filter the best talents through nationwide screening and train them in its youth academy. The youth academy had full-time trainers employed for every age group.[206] As a trainer of the DDR-Oberliga team, Bogs worked with modern training methods, such as video evalutations, which was not yet common in East Germany. The club also applied heart rate and lactate measurements during training, which only came to the Bundesliga many years later.[207][190] Former referee Bernd Heynemann has concluded: \\\"The BFC is not ten times champions because the referees only whistled for Dynamo. They were already strong as a bear.\\\"[208]\\n\\nLast titles in East Germany (1986–1989)\\n\\nMarco Köller (left) and Heiko Scholz of 1.

Hansa Rostock for of the 1986–87 season.[209] Doll and Andreas Thom would form one of the most effective attacking duos in East German football in the late 1980s. BFC Dynamo defeated 1. FC Union Berlin 8–1 in the derby on the fourth matchday of the 1986-87 DDR-Oberliga.[210][211] The East Germany U19 team won the 1986 UEFA European Under-18 Championship, after defeating Italy 3–1 in the final on 15 October 1986. BFC Dynamo was represented by two youth players in the squad: midfielder Marco Köller and defender Hendrik Herzog.[212] [213] Köller and Herzog would then make their debuts for BFC Dynamo in the DDR-Oberliga during the 1986–87 season.[214][215] The team met fierce competition from 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig in the 1986–87 DDR-Oberliga. BFC Dynamo met 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig away on the 20th matchday at the Bruno-Plache-Stadion on 11 April 1987.[216] The two teams had the same number of points going into the match.[217] BFC Dynamo won the match 1–3.[216] The team eventually finished the 1986-87 DDR-Oberliga in first place, 6 points ahead of runner-up SG Dynamo Dresden and 8 points ahead of third-placed 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig.[218]\\n\\n\\nAndreas Thom during a match against SG Dynamo Dresden on 6 April 1988.\\nBFC Dynamo was eliminated in the first round of the 1987-88 European Cup after double defeats against FC Girondins de Bordeaux. Also the 1987-88 DDR-Oberliga meant firece competition from 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig. BFC Dynamo finished the first half of the season as Herbstmeister. The team had the same number of points as second-placed 1. FC Lokomotiv Leipzig and led the league only on goal difference.[219] Andreas Thom was the top scorer in the league by a wide margin, with 14 goals in 13 games in the first half of the season.[220] The second half of the 1987-88 DDR-Oberliga was a tight race against 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig until the end. BFC Dynamo and 1. FC Lokomotive were level on points heading into the final matchday, but BFC Dynamo had the better goal difference.[221] BFC Dynamo defeated FC Vorwärts Frankfurt 1–0 at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark on the final matchday and won its tenth consecutive DDR-Oberliga title. The winning goal was scored by Burkhard Reich.[222] The team then defeated FC Carl Zeiss Jena 2–0 in front of 40,000 spectators at the Stadion der Weltjugend in the final of the 1987–88 FDGB-Pokal and finally completed the Double.[223] Andreas Thom was eventually voted the 1988 East German footballer of the year.[224]\\n\\n\\nAndreas Thom receiving the 1988 East German footballer of the year award from the Die Neue Fußballwoche (de) editor-in-chief Jürgen Nöldner on 13 August 1988.\\nLong-time club president Manfred Kirste was replaced by Herbert Krafft ahead of the 1988–89 season.[225] Krafft had a background in the Volkspolizei.[226] BFC Dynamo was drawn against West German champions SV Werder Bremen in the first round of the 1988-89 European Cup. The first match was played at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark. Among the spectators was the former West German Chancellor Willy Brandt. BFC Dynamo sensationally won the match 3–0.[227] Bodo Rudwaleit was a match hero, with numerous saves.[228] However, the team lost the return leg at the Weser-Stadion with 5–0. The return leg in Bremen would become known as the second \\\"Miracle on the Weser\\\".[228][227] It has been rumored that the spectacular loss in the return leg was explained by BFC Dynamo having been given doping before the home game in East Berlin.[105][229] A more likely explanation, however, is that the players could not cope with the enormous pressure before the return leg.[229] It has also been rumored that the players were distracted from their pre-match preparations by shopping opportunities, which had been arranged by SV Werder Bremen manager Willi Lemke.[229][230] BFC Dynamo lost important points to its league rivals in the autumn and finished the first half of the season in fourth place, a full nine points behind SG Dynamo Dresden. It was the team\'s worst result after a first half of the season in the league in 14 years.[231]\\n\\nAverage attendance had dropped from 15,000 to 9,000 during the team\'s most successful years in the 1980s.[173] Ordinary fans feared the Stasi and had become disillusioned with political interference. Particularly aggravating were the restrictions on ticket sales that the Stasi imposed at international matches for political reasons. Only a few tickets were sold to ordinary fans for matches in the European Cup against opponents such as Hamburger SV and SV Werder Bremen. The majority was instead sold to a politically hand-picked audience.[190][232] BFC Dynamo also saw the emergence of a well-organized hooligan scene during the 1980s.[174][178] The development was partly a response to the increasing state repression against the supporter scene.[190]\\n\\n\\nThe team celebrates the victory in the 1988-89 FDGB-Pokal at the Stadion der Weltjugend on 1 April 1989.\\nBFC Dynamo met local rival 1.

The team met Karl-Marx-Stadt in the final of the 1988-89 FDGB-Pokal. BFC Dynamo won the match 1–0 in front of 35,000 spectators at the Stadion de Weltjugend and captured its second consecutive cup title. The winning goal was scored by Anderas Thom in the 57th minute.[234] BFC Dynamo eventually finished the 1988-89 DDR-Oberliga as runner-up.

Frank Pastor was transferred to BSG Aktivist Schwarze Pumpe at the beginning of the season. BFC Dynamo was qualified for the 1989–90 European Cup Winners\' Cup as winners of the 1988–89 FDGB-Pokal. The team was eliminated in the second round by AS Monaco on the away goals rule. Coach Helmut Jäschke then decided to place young goalkeeper Oskar Kosche in the following match. Long-time goalkeeper Bodo Rudwaleit ten suddenly announced his immediate retirement from football.[239] The East German regime faltered under pressure from political mass demonstrations and events in neighboring countries. Parts of the Berlin Wall were opened on 9 November 1989 and East German citizens could now freely travel to West Berlin. The Stasi was transformed into the Office for National Security (German: Amt für Nationale Sicherheit) (AfNS) on 17 November 1989.[240] The transformation also ended the tenure of Erich Mielke as Minister of State Security.[241] He would soon be dismissed as the First Chairman of SV Dynamo as well.[242][226] Andreas Thom was signed to Bayer Leverkusen by Bayer Leverkusen manager Reiner Calmund. The transfer became official on 12 December 1989. Thom thus became the first player in the DDR-Oberliga to leave for the West German Bundesliga.[243] The transfer fee amounted to 2,5 million Deutsche Mark.[243]\\n\\n\\nThe team of FC Berlin at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark on 23 February 1990.\\nBodo Rudwaleit was transferred to BSG Stahl Einsenhüttenstadt and Bernd Schulz to BSG Bergmann-Borsig during the 1989–1990 winter break. The dismantling of the team from the 1980s was now well underway.[244] Coach Jäschke was dismissed during the winter break and was replaced by Peter Rohde.[245] Rohde had played 159 league- and 14 international matches for BFC Dynamo between 1969 and 1978 and was an older brother of team captain Frank Rohde.[245] The AfNS was eventually completely dissolved on 13 January 1990.[240] With the dissolution of the Stasi, BFC Dynamo had lost a major sponsor. The Ministry of the Interior announced that it was only prepared to support the club until the end of the 1989–90 season.[246][247][248] The fate of the club was uncertain. BFC Dynamo was rebranded as FC Berlin on 19 February 1990.[249][250] Club President Herbert Krafft was dismissed at the same time and Jürgen Bogs took over as interim president until new club elections could be held.[249] The team participated in the first edition of the indoor tournament \\\"Internationales Berliner Hallenfussballurnier\\\" in the Werner-Seelenbinder-Halle. Teams from West Berlin, such as Hertha BSC also participated. FC Berlin lost the final against arch-rival 1. FC Union Berlin with 4–5. Thomas Doll became the best goal scorer of the tournament with 12 goals.[251] The second half of the season started well, but it soon became clear that FC Berlin would not would not have a chance at the title.[252] FC Berlin finished the 1989-90 DDR-Oberliga in fourth place and failed for the first time in a long time to qualify for a European tournament.[253] Attendance dropped from 7,271 in the fall of 1989 to just 3,383 in the spring of 1990.[254] The team lost Thomas Doll and Frank Rohde to Hamburger SV and Rainer Ernst to 1. FC Kaiserslautern after the season.[255][256]\\n\\n\\nDirk Rehbein chasing the ball during a match between FC Berlin and HFC Chemie at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark on 10 November 1990.\\nThe team was joined by Dirk Rehbein from SC Fortuna Köln during the summer of 1990. FC Berlin participated in the 1990 Intertoto Cup 30 June 1990 and 17 July 1990. FC Berlin had sold off almost all its offensive players during the 1989–90 season and the team finished the tournament in third place.[257][258][259] FC Berlin also recruited Mikhail Pronichev from FC Lokomotiv Moscow for the 1990–91 season.[260][261] The team began the 1990-91 NOFV-Oberliga with four consecutive defeats and was in last place in the league after the fourth matchday. Jürgen Bogs returned as coach.[262][263] A wave of hooliganism swept through East Germany in 1990.[178] One of the largest hooligan scenes in Germany was formed around FC Berlin.[253] 18-year-old FC Berlin supporter Mike Polley was shot dead by police during riots in Leutzsch in connection with the match between FC Sachsen Leipzig and FC Berlin on 3 November 1990. The police had fired between 50 and 100 shots in one minute.[264] The hooligan scene of FC Berlin would shape the entire 1990–91 season.[265] FC Berlin continued to struggle in the second half of the league season. The team was in 12th place in the league towards the end of the season.[266] However, FC Berlin won its last two matches in the league, against Chemnitzer FC and FC Victoria 91 Frankfurt, and finished the 1990-91 NOFV-Oberliga in 11th place.[266] The team was thus qualified for the play-off for the 2. Bundesliga. FC Berlin was one point behind leaders BSV Stahl Brandeburg before the final round. The team defeated 1. FC Magdeburg 3–5 away, but BSV Stahl Brandenburg defeated 1. FC Union Berlin 0–2 away. FC Berlin thus finished in second place and just narrowly failed to qualify for the 2. Bundesliga.[267][268][257] The team lost several key-players after the season, such as Heiko Bonan, Burkhard Reich, Waldemar Ksienzyk, Thorsten Boer, Eike Küttner and Hendrik Herzog.[268][269]\\n\\nDecline (1991-1994)\\nFC Berlin recruited midfielder Ralf Rambow from Eisenhüttenstädter FC Stahl for the 1991–92 season. The 1991–92 season was the first season when teams from East Germany and teams from West Germany played in the same league system. The NOFV-Oberliga was now at third tier in the league system. FC Berlin was qualified for the 1991-92 DFB-Pokal as a participant in the 1990–91 2. Bundesliga play-off. It was the club\'s first participation in the DFB-Pokal. The team was drawn against SC Freiburg. The starting eleven included players such as Oskar Kosche, Christian Backs, Jens-Uwe Zöphel, Jörg Fügner, Mario Tolkmitt and Mikhail Pronichev. FC Berlin lost the match 0–2.[270] Heiko Brestrich returned to the team during the summer of 1991.[271] Brestrich would be a key-player of FC Berlin in the 1990s. FC Berlin came to dominate the 1991-92 NOFV-Oberliga. The team lost only two matches during the entire league season and scored a total of 97 goals.[272] FC Berlin was once again qualified for the play-off for the 2. Bundesliga. The team finished the play-off in third place. Volkswagen-backed VfL Wolfsburg won the play-off, which meant that no team from the former East Germany was able to advance.[272] FC Berlin lost 11 players after the 1991–92 season, including Mario Tolkmitt, Christian Backs, Jörn Lenz, Jörg Fügner and Oskar Kosche.[273][274] In total, FC Berlin lost two complete teams in the first one or two years after the fall of the Berlin Wall.[256]\\n\\nFailing to win win promotion to the 2. Bundesliga, FC Berlin had to continue at amateur level. The main competitors in the following seasons of the NOFV-Oberliga Nord were teams such as Tennis Borussia Berlin, BSV Stahl Brandenburg and Eisenhüttenstädter FC Stahl. With the many player departures after the 1991–92 season, Jürgen Bogs once again had to build a new team.[273] FC Berlin recruited forward Bernd Jopek for 1. FC Union Berlin and midfielder Stefan Oesker from Blau-Weiß 1890 Berlin for the 1992–93 season.[273] The team was also strengthened by a number of youth players.[273] FC Berlin now had to rely on its youth department to supply the team with new players.[275] The team finished the 1992-93 NOFV-Oberliga Nord in fourth place. Dirk Rehbein and Ralf Rambow left for 1. FC Union Berlin after the season.[276][277] FC Berlin was no longer the absolute treasure trove among former East German clubs, but continued to produce talent thanks to its excellent youth work.[277] Among the players from the youth department on the squad in 1993–94 season were Jens Reckmann, Mike Jesse, Ronny Nikol, Michael Franke, Marcell Fensch and Rayk Schröder.[278][275][273][276][277] The team of FC Berlin that played against Spandauer SV on the fifth matchday on 9 September 1993 had an avagerage age of only 21,33 and was the youngest team of BFC Dynamo to have ever played a competitive match.[279] Helmut Koch replaced Jürgen Bogs as coach on 28 September 1993.[280] FC Berlin finished the 1993-94 NOFV-Oberliga Nord in fourth place and qualified for the new Regionalliga Nordost.\\n\\nRegionalliga Nordost and first Berlin cup title (1994–1999)\\nMario Kallnik returned to the club for the 1994–95 season. The re-instated Regionalliga would now form the new third tier in the German football league system. The 1994-95 Regionalliga Nordost meant new meetings with well-known opponents such as FC Carl Zeiss Jena, 1. FC Union Berlin and FC Rot-Weiß Erfurt.[281] BFC Dynamo struggled in the 1994-95 Regionalliga Nordost, but managed to retain its place in the league.[282] Jens-Uwe Zöphel left the team for FC Energie Cottbus after the season. The team was joined by goalkeeper Daniel Bartel from the youth department for the 1995–96 season. Bartel became the new first-choice goalkeeper at the beginning of the season. The highlights of the 1995-96 Regionalliga Nordost were new meetings with old rival 1. FC Dynamo Dresden.[283] The two teams had not met since the 1990–91 season.[284][281] The first meeting was played in front of 2,002 spectators at the Stadion im Sportforum on 8 September 1995. The score was 1–3 at half break.[283] The match ended 4–3 to 1. FC Dynamo Dresden.[284][281] Club President Klaus Bittroff resigned on 14 September 1995 and Vice president Volkmar Wanski became the new club president.[285] The team had a difficult start to the 1995-95 Regionalliga Nordost. Due to acute danger of relegation, coach Koch was dismissed on 17 October 1995. Werner Voigt became the new coach.[286][287] Voigt had a long background in the club as a player and coach. With Voigt, the experienced defender Mario Maek also returned to the club.[286] FC Berlin organized one of the biggest youth football tournaments so far in the eastern part of the country in the Sportforum Hohenschönhausen on 6–8 April 1996. As many as 30 youth teams from clubs such as Chelsea F.C., Everton F.C., Feyenoord, FC Bayern München and Borussia Dortmund participated.[288][287] FC Berlin found itself in the relegation zone towards the end of the 1995-95 Regionalliga Nordost.[289] The place in the league was saved with a 1–0 win over FSV Wacker 90 Nordhausen on the 33rd matchday, 19 May 1996. The winning goal was scored by Mario Maek.[283]\\n\\nExperienced players such as Heiko Brestrich, Mario Maek, and Jens Reckmann would form the team\'s backbone during the 1996–67 season.[290] FC Berlin defeated 1. FC Dynamo Dresden 2–0 in the opening match of the 1996–97 Regionalliga Nordost in front of 2,300 spectators at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark.[291] Then followed a sharp decline.[292] The team would lose 6–0 away to its other rival 1. FC Union on the ninth matchday.[293] It was the biggest loss to date against 1. FC Union Berlin.[294] Club President Wanski announced on 26 November 1996 that the financial reserves had been used up.[287] The millions of Deutsche Mark that the club had made from player transfers in the early 1990s were now gone.[295] Wanski would then support the club every year with personal contributions.[296][297] During the second half of the 1995–96 season, he became shirt sponsor with his own company Regio Bautenschutz GmbH.[290] The shirts had not had a sponsor in almost seven years.[290] FC Berlin also signed a two-year sponsoring contract with the Italian sportswear manufacturer Fila during the spring of 1996, where Fila became the club\'s equipment sponsor. The club previously had no equipment sponsor.[298] Fila had reportedly been impressed by the club\'s youth work.[298] FC Berlin finished the 1996-67 Regionaliga Nordost on 13th place after another weak season. Mikhail Pronichev left the team for TuS Makkabi Berlin and Jens Reckmann for 1. FC Dynamo Dresden after the season.\\n\\nThe team recruited Croatian defender Davor Krznarić for the 1997–98 season. The 1997-98 Regionalliga Nordost was also a struggle, with the team in 12th place in the league at the winter break.[299] The club still received New Year\'s greetings from Real Madrid and Liverpool F.C. in 1997.[300] Experienced defender Jörn Lenz returned to the club during the winter break.[301] Lenz would be a key player for several seasons to come. The successes in the Regionalliga Nordost had not materialized. It became known that coach Voigt had signed for 1. FC Dynamo Dresden for the 1998–99 season. The club and Voigt decided to part ways.[302] Assistant coach Ingo Rentzsch took over on 12 March 1998.[303] The team played an exciting 5–5 draw away against 1. FC Magdeburg away on the 33rd matchday, 5 May 1998. Bernd Jopek, Jörn Lenz, Davor Krznarić, Marek Seruga, and Mario Kallnik scored one goal each in the match.[303][304] New coach for the 1998–99 season was Henry Häusler.[305] Players central to the team in the 1998–99 season were Heiko Brestrich, Jörn Lenz, Mario Maek, Martino Gatti, Mario Kallnik, Davor Krznarić, Timo Lesch, and Sven Ohly, with Lenz as team captain.[305][306] Coach Häusler was eventually dismissed on 18 March 1999 and assistant coach Ingo Rentzsch again took over as interim coach.[307] Club President Wanski came up with the idea to revive the old name BFC Dynamo during the autumn of 1998. He said: \\\"We stand by Dynamo\'s sporting tradition, we reject the club\'s political past.\\\"[308][297] An overwhelming majority at the general meeting on 8 May 1999 voted to take back the old name.[309] The team met local rival Union Berlin on the penultimate matchday of the 1998-99 Regionalliga Nordost, 8 May 1999. The team now again competed as BFC Dynamo. Coach Rentzsch threw in the towel at half-time and left the stadium, allegedly because Club President Wanski had wanted to dictate the line-up.[310][311][312] Youth trainer Norbert Paepke took over as coach in the second half of the match.[310][313] BFC Dynamo won the derby 2–0 with two goals by Marcel Solomo in front of 2,543 spectators at the Stadion an der Alten Försterei.[314] BFC Dynamo reached the final of the 1998-99 Berlin Cup. The team defeated Berlin Türkspor 1965 with 4–1 in the final on 11 May 1999 and finally won its first Berlin Cup title. Ayhan Gezen and Mario Maek scored one goal each, and Heiko Brestrich scored two goals for BFC Dynamo in the final.[315]\\n\\nRelegation to NOFV-Oberliga and crash (1999–2001)\\nBFC Dynamo recruited goalkeeper Nico Thomaschewski for the 1999–2000 season. Thomaschewski became the new first-choice goalkeeper. Torsten Boer, Jens Reckmann and Dirk Rehbein also returned to the club.[316][317] The team was also joined by forward Marcel Riediger from the youth department. Marcel Riediger was the son of former BFC Dynamo striker Hans-Jürgen Riediger.[318][319] The team lost 0–2 to Arminia Bielefeld the first round of the 1999-2000 DFB-Pokal.[320] BFC Dynamo defeated SG Dynamo Dresden 1–0 on the sixth matchday.[316] The team stood at a sensational second place in the league after the eight matchday, but then followed a sharp descline.[321][322] BFC Dynamo suffered a period of crisis during the autumn of 1999.[323] The financial difficulties had continued. The number of sponsors was too few and the club was financially dependent on Club President Volkmar Wanski. The number of spectators also remained low and new sponsors were deterred by hooliganism.[311] The team went through several league matches without a single win. Heiko Brestrich eventually rebelled against coach Klaus Goldbach in early November 1999 and was suspended. He was then sacked and transferred to VfB Leipzig.[324][325][326][327] Brestrich was very popular with the supporters of BFC Dynamo and was popularly called \\\"Heiko Brestrich - Football God\\\" (German: Heiko Brestrich - Fußballgott).[324][328] He had played a total of 301 matches for BFC Dynamo during his career, including 282 matches between 1991 and 1999.[324][329] The team was joined by Russian striker Denis Kozlov later the same month. Kozlov would eventually prove successful at BFC Dynamo. Coach Goldbach was eventually dismissed in early December 1999 and Jürgen Bogs returned for his third stint as coach.[330]\\n\\nThe club finally got a promising main sponsor in the form of the software company Lipro AG at the beginning of 2000.[331][332] However, the difficulties in the league continued and the club\'s liabilities had already started to become significant.[332] BFC Dynamo finished the 1999-2000 Regionalliga Nordost in 17th place and was relegated to the NOFV-Oberliga Nord. For the first time in its history, BFC Dynamo was now a fourth tier team.[333] BFC Dynamo reached the final of the Berlin Cup for a second consecutive season, but lost the final of the 1999-2000 Berlin Cup 2–0 against the reserve team of Tennis Borussia Berlin.[334] Club President Wanski resigned on 29 June 2000.[335][336][337] The reason was allegedly that the sponsor Lipro AG demanded greater influence in club decision making.[335][336] The club was now temporary in the hands of Sports director Hans Reker.[335] Mario Maek retired as a player after the 1999–2000 season and several players left the team, including Thorsten Boer and Martino Gatti.[335][336] A new team was put together for the 2000-01 NOFV-Oberliga Nord. The budget for the season was 2.3 million Deutsche Mark, which set new record for the NOFV-Oberliga Nord.[336] The team was joined by striker Dirk Vollmar, Cameroonian midfielder Aka Adek Mba, Brazilian midfielder Alexandre Vieira dos Santos, nicknamed \\\"Macalé\\\", as well as five Romanian players: Dănuț Oprea, Silvian Cristescu, Aurel Panait, Dorel Zegrean, and Florin Bătrânu.[336][338] SPD-politician Karin Halsch became new club president on 27 September 2000.[339][340][nb 7] BFC Dynamo dominated the 2000-01 NOFV-Oberliga Nord. The team was drawn against arch-rival 1. FC Union Berlin in the quarter-finals of the 2000-01 Berlin Cup The match was played in front of 4,427 spectators at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark on 24 March 2001. BFC Dynamo lost 3–0.[341] Serious riots broke out after the match when BFC Dynamo supporters clashed with the police.[342] The team finished the 2000-01 NOFV-Oberliga in first place, with only three losses in 34 matches.[343] Denis Kozlov had scored a wopping 29 goals for BFC Dynamo in the league.[343] The team would now face 1. FC Magdeburg in a play-off for promotion to the Regionalliga Nord.\\n\\nHowever, it had become apparent that the club had serious financial problems two weeks before the play-offs. Players and coaches had received their January salaries in March and had not received any salaries since. The club was also behind with insurance payments.[344][345][346] The German Football Association (DFB) demanded that the club could provide a bank guarantee of 4.2 million Deutsche Mark to secure the budget for the possible 2001–02 Regionalliga Nord. It was already clear before the first match in the play-offs that the club would have difficulty meeting the requirements of the DFB in the event of promotion.[343][347] The first match of the play-offs ended 0–0 in front of 8,282 spectators at the Stadion im Sportforum on 2 June 2001.[348] The second match was played at the Ernst-Grube-Stadion in Magdeburg on 9 June 2001. Around 2,000 supporters from BFC Dynamo traveled to the second match.[349][350] The score was 2–2 at half time. BFC Dynamo was practically promoted at this point.[348] However, the team ultimately lost the match 2–5.[348][351] The club\'s debts were now estimated at 1.5 million Deutsche Mark.[352] And now, also the main sponsor Lipro AG was in financial trouble.[353][354] Several players left the club directly after the 2000–01 season, including Marcel Riediger and Denis Kozlov.[343][352]\\n\\nInsolvency (2001–2002)\\nInsurance company AOK filed for insolvency against BFC Dynamo on 21 June 2001. The company demanded 126,000 Deutsche Mark in unpaid insurance payments.[355] Club President Karin Halsch resigned on 25 June 2001.[355] There had been major discrepancies between Halsch and sports director Hans Reker regarding how the situation should be resolved.[355] Reker took over as acting president.[356] Supporters of BFC Dynamo started the fundraiser \\\"Save BFC Dynamo\\\" (German: Rettet den BFC). The fundraiser quickly succeeded in raising 40,000 Euros.[357][358][359] More players left the team during the summer of 2001, including Mario Kallnik and Aka Adeck Mba.[360] The debts were estimated at 5 millions Deutsche Mark, of which 4.2 million were loans from Lipro AG and 1.3 short-term debts, at this point.[361] The club tried to initiate a partnership with FC Dynamo Moscow, in which BFC Dynamo would serve as a farm team for FC Dynamo Moscow in Europe.[362] But the plan led nowhere.[363] A preliminary insolvency administrator was appointed at the end of August 2001.[364] It was estimated that insolvency proceedings could be opened on 1 November 2001.[365] Insolvency proceedings were opened against main sponsor Lipro AG on 5 October 2001.[366]\\n\\nThe preliminary insolvency administrator estimated the club\'s debts at 6 million Deutsche Mark.[367] BFC Dynamo needed 30,000 Deutsche Mark by 31 October 2001 in order to commence insolvency proceedings.[368] However, the club did not have the money.[369] Discussions with new sponsors failed.[370] If insolvency proceedings could not be opened, the club would go bankrupt and have to restart in the Kreisliga under a new name.[363][365][371][368] Supporters organized a demonstration that marched from the Sportforum Hohenschönhausen to the Rotes Rathaus. Also former players such as Hans-Jürgen Riediger, Rainer Troppa, Waldemar Ksienzyk and Heiko Brestrich planned to participate. The demonstration was received at the Rotes Rathaus by former club president and SPD-politician Halsch.[369][372][368] A group of sponsors around former president Volkmar Waski finally came forward and offered the money required to commence insolvency proceedings.[373][374] The club\'s entire presidium resigned on 31 October 2001.[375][337] An emergency board formed by André Sommer, Rayk Bernt and press spokesman Holger Zimmermann was appointed by the club\'s Economic Council.[376][370]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo is said to have made millions on player sales after Die Wende.[356][377][378] The club was for a time considered the richest amateur club in Germany.[295] But not all the money had went to the club, some had also went to SV Dynamo, DFV and advisers.[379][380] The club\'s reputation as the former Stasi club made it difficult to win new sponsors.[296][381][356][382] The club was also plagued by hooliganism, which repeatedly caused negative headlines.[382][340] FC Berlin failed to qualify for the 2. Bundesliga and never progressed beyond the third tier of the German football league system.[383] The number of spectators was only a couple of hundred per match in the early 1990s and the income from membership fees was marginal.[382][383] The club also maintained a large youth department which at one point cost about 400,000 Deutsche Mark per year.[382] At the end of 1996, the club still had no debts, but also no money left in its bank accounts.[296] President Wanski would then have to support the club with his own financial contributions.[296] It is estimated that Wanski invested an estimated 3 million Deutsche Mark of private money in the club over the five years before his resignation.[384] BFC Dynamo finally got a promising new sponsor in the form of Lipro AG in early 2000. Millions of Deutsche Mark would now be available.[385] But the club\'s liabilites had already started to become significant.[385] The club made a bid to reach the third tier Regionalliga Nord, and sports director Hans Reker started signing new players.[385] However, the millions from sponsor Lipro AG would later turn out to be loans.[385]\\n\\nThe emergency board was considered to represent the interest of the sponsor group around Wanski.[386] André Sommer and Rayk Bernt were controversial due to their membership in the Hells Angels.[387] However, both were also long-time supporters; Sommer had been a member of the hooligan scene back in the 1980s.[388][389] Zimmermann resigned from the emergency board on 23 November 2001, as he thought Sommer and Berndt had given the club an image he could not identify with.[390] A new presidium was due to be elected at a general meeting on 26 November 2001.[337] But the general meeting was converted into an \\\"information event\\\" by a vote of 87 to 59, at the insistence of the emergency board.[390][391] Some club members felt they had been blackmailed.[391] Sommer and Bernt continued to lead the club during the opening of the insolvency proceedings, but the legitimacy of their presidium was questioned.[390]\\n\\nInsolvency proceedings were opened on 1 November 2001.[392][393][394] BFC Dynamo was thus automatically relegated to the Verbandsliga Berlin.[372] All contracts with professionals and employees were terminated.[372][395][396][393] The club now had to continue under amateur conditions, the players could only be offered 300 Euros per month.[369][337] Only three players from the original squad remained for the first mandatory friendly match, one of them was team captain Piotr Rowicki.[397][337] Jörn Lenz left for VfB Leipzig and Nico Thomaschewski for SV Babelsberg 03.[337] Coach Jürgen Bogs also decided not to continue.[374][398] Former assistant coach Mario Maek stepped in as the new coach on a voluntary basis, assisted by goalkeeping coach Bodo Rudwaleit.[398] The club once again had to rely on its youth players.[399]\\n\\nSommer and Bernt met great opposition due to their membership in the Hells Angels.[400] The duo had a deterrent effect and failed to attract new sponsors.[388][401] Supporters collected signatures to elect a new presidium.[388][402] But the signatures were ignored by Sommer and Berndt.[388][402] The former coach of the women\'s team Volkmar Lucius then took legal action for violation of the statutes.[388][402] The Sommer and Bernt presidium was then finally overthrown by supporters and Lucius, through a successful application to the Charlottenburg District Court.[388][402][401] The court appointed Lucius as an emergency board member on 30 April 2002.[388][403] Sommer and Bernt had, after all, helped make sure that the insolvency proceedings could be opened by their personal financial contributions.[402][404] But the duo would no longer have much say in the club after 2003.[405] The interest group IG BFC\'er managed to persuade entrepreneur Mike Peters to become the new club president.[401][404] Peters was elected as the new president on 31 May 2002.[406] The preferential claims of 204,000 Euros looked insurmountable.[401] But the supporters had negotiated with creditors and received numerous waivers.[401][407] They had also set up a donations account and collected at least 13,800 Euros themselves.[407][406] The new presidum around Peters would also contribute 100,000 Euros from private money to the insolvency plan.[406][401][407] Peters also committed to funding a large part of the budget for the 2002-03 Verbandsliga Berlin.[406][408]\\n\\nRestart in Verbandsliga Berlin and end of insolvency (2002–2004)\\nFormer BFC Dynamo player Dirk Vollmar became the new coach for the 2002–03 season.[406] Bodo Rudwaleit continued as assistant coach.[406] Nico Thomaschewski and Aka Adeck Mba returned for the 2002–03 season.[409][410] The team was also joined by defender Robert Rudwaleit from the reserve team.[411][408][412] Robert Rudwaleit was the son of Bodo Rudwaleit and had made his first few appearances with the first team during the previous season.[413] BFC Dynamo defeated the reserve team of 1. FC Union Berlin in both meetings in 2002-03 Verbandsliga Berlin.[414] The team eventuallty finished its first season in the Verbandsliga Berlin in third place.[414] The insolvency situation was complex. The club had about 170 creditors. It was still unclear whether the insolvency proceedings could be successful.[415]\\n\\nJörn Lenz returned to the club for the 2003–04 season.[416] BFC Dynamo also recruited striker Danny Kukulies from SC Pfullendorf for the season. Kukulies had a long background in the youth department of BFC Dynamo.[417] BFC Dynamo was in third place after the first half of the season, nine points behind BFC Preussen and six points behind second placed SV Tasmania Gropiusstadt 73.[418] The team defeated SV Tasmania Gropiusstadt 73 2–1 in the first league match after the winter break, with one goal by Lenz and one goal by Robert Rudwaleit.[419] The team would also win the following matches.[420] BFC Dynamo eventually finished the 2003-04 Verbandsliga Berlin in first place and won promotion back to the NOFV-Oberliga Nord. The team had won all 17 matches in the second half of the league season, which set new record in the Verbandsliga Berlin.[421] Danny Kukulies scored 32 goals and Tomasz Suwary 22 goals in the 2003-04 Verbandsliga Berlin.[422] The insolvency proceedings would finally come to a positive conclusion after a meeting with the creditors at the Charlottenburg District Court on 8 June 8, 2004.

The team is occasionally nicknamed \\\"die Weinroten\\\", which means \\\"the Clarets\\\".[626][627]\\n\\nThe BFC Dynamo away kit has traditionally been a white shirt, paired with claret or white shorts and socks. However, the team used green away shirts from the end of the 1960s until the mid-1970s.[628][83] Green was the colour of the Volkspolizei, which was the official sponsor of BFC Dynamo during the East German era. The green away shirt was then exchanged for a white away shirt, paired with red or white shorts and socks.[93][99] The team used entirely red away kits during the 1981–82 and 1982–83 seasons.[629][630] The red away kit was then exchanged for a claret away kit.[631] The team again used white away shirts from the 1985–86 season.[632] The 1985–86 season also saw the instruction of a new claret and white diagonally striped away shirt.[632] The diagonally striped away shirt would be used for the rest of the 1980s.[237]\\n\\nThe club was rebranded as FC Berlin on 19 February 1990. A pure white was set as the new match colour with immediate effect.[633] FC Berlin then adopted a red and white colour scheme for the 1990–91 season.[634] In the eyes of the supporters, the red and white kit looked a lot like 1. FC Union Berlin.[634] The club played in red and white home kits for most of the FC Berlin era, but wore a black and red striped home shirt, paired with black shorts and socks from the 1996–97 season through the 1998–99 season. The club returned to its original club name on 3 May 1999 and consequently also later returned to its traditional colour scheme.[635]\\n\\n1966-1990, 1999–2009, 2023-\\n1966-1990, 1999–2009, 2023-\\n\\n \\n2009-2023\\n2009-2023\\n\\nThe crest of BFC Dynamo during the East German era featured a stylized \\\"D\\\" for SV Dynamo and the lettering \\\"BFC\\\" in red and yellow on a white background, surrounded by a yellow wreath.[636][637] BFC Dynamo abandoned its East German crest when the club was rebranded as FC Berlin on 19 February 1990.[638][639][636] The club used two different crests during the FC Berlin era. The first crest featured a stylized image of the roof of the Brandenburg Gate with the lettering \\\"FCB\\\" underneath and the club name \\\"Fussballclub Berlin\\\" in capital letters at the bottom, in white on a red background. It was only briefly used during the spring of 1990.[640] The second crest featured a stylized image of a football with the Brandenburg Gate in front, the lettering \\\"FCB\\\" at the top and the club name \\\"FC Berlin\\\" at the bottom, in red on a white background. This crest was used from the spring of 1990 until the end of the FC Berlin era.[640][284]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo reclaimed its East German crest when the club returned to its original club name on 3 May 1999.[639] But the club was no longer in possession of the crest.[639] The club had neglected to seek legal protection for its East German crest after German reunification. The neglect was likely due to managerial inexperience. Protection of trademarks was neither necessary nor common in East Germany.[636] The crest was now owned by Peter Klaus-Dieter Mager, commonly known as \\\"Pepe\\\". Pepe Mager was a famous fan of Hertha BSC and a fan merchandise dealer.[641] The club tried to recover the crest from Mager though court action, without success.[639][636] The ownership of the crest was instead passed on to Rayk Bernt and his company RA-BE Immobilien- und Handelsgesellschaft mbH.[479][642][643]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo continued to use the disputed crest on its kits and webpage. But the club would have to ask the owner of the crest every time it wanted to have a pennant made and was unable to exploit the commercial value of the crest for its own benefit.[479][516] The legal situation around the crest would also have caused problems in the event of an advance to the Regionalliga, as the German football Association (DFB) required clubs to own their crests.[517] In order establish independence, the club finally decided to adopt a new crest in 2009.[467]\\n\\nThe new crest abandoned the traditional stylized \\\"D\\\" and the lettering \\\"BFC\\\", as they would have met legal obstacles.[643] The new crest featured a black Berlin bear on claret and white stripes, together with the club name and the founding year.[643] The first version of the new crest sparked controversy. The word \\\"fußball\\\" in the club name had been written in lower case with a double \\\"s\\\" instead of the graphene \\\"ß\\\".[643] This was contrary to German spelling rules, where it is only permissible to write \\\"fußball\\\" with a double \\\"s\\\" when the word is written in upper case. Club President Norbert Uhlig ensured that there was absolutely no ulterior motive behind the spelling and claimed that the word had always been spelled like that on club pennants and scarfs.[643] The Chairman of the Economic Council Peter Meyer later claimed that the spelling was a deliberate marketing ploy, in order to have new crest immediately known across Germany.[643] A second version of the crest was soon made public, where the club name was written in upper case. The new crest was used by BFC Dynamo from the 2009–10 season.[516]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo finally managed win back the traditional crest in 2022, through the Chairman of the Economic Council Peter Meyer. Meyer had acquired the rights to the crest through one of his companies.[644] From the 2023–24 season, BFC Dynamo is once again playing with its traditional crest. The traditional crest was displayed for the first time since its reintroduction in a friendly match against Hertha BSC in front of more than 10,000 spectators at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark on 7 July 2023.[645][646]\\n\\nOwnership of the traditional crest\\nMany clubs in East Germany rushed to drop their East German names during the Peaceful revolution. BFC Dynamo was among the clubs to do so, in an attempt to distance the club from the Stasi.[639][250] The club was rebranded as FC Berlin on 19 February 1990 and consequently abandoned its East German crest.\\n\\nPepe Mager was a famous fan of Hertha BSC and fan merchandise dealer.[641] Mager had organized away trips for the fans Hertha in the early 1960s and was one of the founders of the notorious supporter group \\\"Hertha-Frösche\\\". He now sold his own fan merchandise from a mobile stand outside the Olympiastadion.[641][647][648] Mager inquired with the register of associations in Charlottenburg in 1991 about all deleted names of East German clubs.[641] He immediately found BFC Dynamo and saw business opportunities.[641][639] Mager claimed that he first secured the former crest of BFC Dynamo for 80 D-Marks in 1992.[381][643]\\n\\nThe name FC Berlin never became popular with the fans.[250] Fans continued to identify themselves with the former name and crest.[639] An overwhelming majority voted for the club to take back its original club name at the general meeting on 3 May 1999.[635] Of the 135 present, 125 voted in favor, three against and seven abstained.[309] BFC Dynamo thus reclaimed its East German crest, but the rights to the crest now belonged to Mager.[639] Mager had registered the crest in his name at the German Patent and Trademark Office on 13 May 1997.[639][649][636]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo contacted Mager for a co-operation, but an agreement could not be reached.[641][649] Mager held the opinion that the club should buy its merchandise from him, or simply buy the rights to the crest.[639] He later informed the club that he had received interest from foreign buyers and offered the club to buy the rights.[649] He claimed that the crest was worth 200,000 D-Marks.[639] BFC Dynamo on the other hand claimed that the crest should legally belong to the club. The club sued Mager in court on 20 November 2000, but eventually lost the case.[639][636] The club decided to suspend the legal dispute with Mager in the summer of 2001 and instead wanted to find a solution outside court.[650] Mager was repeatedly exposed to minor threats from the environment around BFC Dynamo and eventually sold the crest to Rayk Bernt and his company RA-BE Immobilien- und Handelsgesellschaft mbH for a price of 50,000 D-Marks in June 2002.[479][642][517][651]\\n\\nBernt was a close associate of André Sommer.[652] Bernt and Sommer had assisted the club at the opening of the insolvency proceedings in 2001–2002.[652][453][479] Both were long time fans of BFC Dynamo.[653][479][642] But the duo was controversial for their connections to Hells Angels.[653][652] Bernt and Sommer were almost as restrictive towards the club when it came to the crest as Mager had been. Bernt organized the production of fan merchandise in his own regime.[642] The club would have to ask his company every time it wanted to have a pennant made.[479] Bernt and Sommer usually agreed, manufactured the pennant and then sold it at their own fan merchandise stand at the stadium.[479] BFC Dynamo continued to use the crest and would at times be given ten percent of the revenues from their sales.[453][479][642][643] The club eventually offered 5,000 Euros for the crest, but was turned down.[453] Sponsor Peter Meyer was also said to have offered 150,000 euros for the buyback.[478] Bernt demanded a seven-digit sum, according to former Club President Mario Weinkauf.[453] The lawyer representing RA-BE Immobilien- und Handelsgesellschaft mbH allegedly claimed the crest was worth around 600,000 Euros at the time.[654]\\n\\nPresident Weinkauf planned to recover the rights to the former crest with the help of Thomas Thiel and the company Treasure AG before the general meeting on 23 June 2007. Thiel was a co-owner of Treasure AG, which was intended as a new major sponsor.[479] Bernt sold parts of the rights to the former crest to Thiel.[655] The price was allegedly a six-digit sum.[479][643] According to the plan, the club would be given the rights of use to the crest. The profits would thus go to the club. The club would pay a symbolic sum of 1 Euro per month for the rights of use. BFC Dynamo would then have a right of first refusal after the ten-year contract had expired and thus have the opportunity to eventually acquire ownership of the crest.[479][656] However, Weinkauf was ultimately rejected by club members in a vote of no-confidence at the general meeting on 23 June 2007.[485] Weinkauf would then be contacted by the former president of Tennis Borussia Berlin Peter Antony. Treasure AG became a sponsor of Tennis Borussia Berlin instead and Weinkauf would later become president of the club.[480]\\n\\nThiel sold his rights to the crest back to Bernt and his company BFC Dynamo Vermarktungsgesellschaft m.b.H in 2009.[657] The rights to the old crest where subsequently controlled again by the company RA-BE Immobilien- und Handelsgesellschaft mbH.[658][659] The company is controlled by Bernt, who sold occasional items with the former crest at his own webpage.[638] However, RA-BE Immobilien- und Handelsgesellschaft mbH transferred its rights to company AXXON AG in 2022.[660][661] In connection with the club\'s 57th anniversary in 2023, the Chairman of the Economic Council Peter Meyer revealed in an exclusive interview with Berliner Kurier that he had acquired the rights to the crest for the club through one of his companies. After more than 13 years, the traditional crest was finally back with the club. According to Berliner Kurier and Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk (MDR), a six-digit sum is said to have become due.[644][662]\\n\\nChampionship star\\nThe German Football League (DFL) introduced a system of championship stars in the 2004–05 season. The system was meant to honor the most successful teams in the Bundesliga by allowing teams to display stars on their shirts for the championships they have won. The system awarded one star for three titles, two stars for five titles, and three stars for ten titles.[663] However, the system only counted titles won in the Bundesliga since the 1963–64 season.[664][665][666]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo submitted an application to the DFL and the DFB on 9 August 2004 to receive three stars for its ten titles in the DDR-Oberliga. The club asked for equal rights and argued that the German Football Association (DFB) had absorbed the German Football Association of the GDR (DFV) with all its statistics, international matches and goal scorers.[663][667][668][664] BFC Dynamo received support from Dynamo Dresden and 1. FC Magdeburg in its attempts to achieve recognition for East German titles.[667][664]\\n\\nThe DFL responded that it was not the responsible body, but the DFB remained silent for a long time.[665] The DFB eventually declared itself responsible and recommended BFC Dynamo to submit a formal application for a new title symbol in accordance with a relevant paragraph.[664][665] BFC Dynamo commissioned a law firm in Mitte in January 2005 and sent a new letter to the DFB. The DFB announced that the application from BFC Dynamo was going to be negotiated in a meeting with the DFB presidium.[665] The meeting with the DFB presidium on 18 March 2005 agreed that all titles won in East Germany, as well all others titles won in Germany since the first recognized championship in 1903, should qualify for stars.[669] However, the decision was subject to approval by the DFL.[670] No final decision had yet been made by the DFB presidium.[671][672][673][674]\\n\\n\\nBFC Dynamo is allowed to wear one star inscribed with the number ten for its ten East German championships.\\nHowever, BFC Dynamo took matters in its own hands and unilaterally emblazoned its shirts with three stars.[672] The team displayed the three stars for first time in the match against FC Energie Cottbus II on 25 March 2005.[672] The claim by BFC Dynamo was controversial because the club had been the favorite club of Erich Mielke and had had a connection to the Stasi during the East German era.[672][673][675][676][666] Critics in the DFB environment pointed to politically influenced championships in East Germany. BFC Dynamo had been sponsored by the Stasi and had enjoyed advantages.[665] The club had privileged access to talents and a permanent training camp at Uckley in Königs Wusterhausen. However, also other clubs in East Germany had enjoyed similar advantages, which put the DFB in a difficult situation.[665] Also former East German referee and CDU parliamentarian Bernd Heynemann spoke out for recognition of all East German titles.[666]\\n\\nThe DFL rejected the application from the DFB and recommended the DFB to only honor clubs that were champions in the Bundesliga.[677] However, the DFB chose to not follow the recommendation. The DFB presidium instead decided on a compromise solution on 19 July 2005 and adopted a new regulation for the 2005–06 season which gave all clubs the right to wear one single star for the championships they have won in the former East Germany and in Germany since 1903. Clubs were also allowed to indicate the number of championships they have won in the center of the star.[678][679][680] The regulation only applies to clubs playing in a league under the DFB umbrella. It does not apply to clubs playing in the 2. Bundesliga and Bundesliga, which are organized by the DFL.[679]\\n\\nThe new regulation meant that BFC Dynamo was finally allowed to emblazon its shirts with a championship star. The regulation also affected other former East German teams including Dynamo Dresden with its eight titles, 1. FC Frankfurt with its six titles and Magdeburg with its three titles in the Oberliga.[665][680] BFC Dynamo has since then used the championship star in accordance with DFB graphic standards, displaying a star inscribed with the number ten for its ten East German titles.[681]\\n\\nStadiums\\nMain article: Stadion im Sportforum\\nThe long-time home and training facility of BFC Dynamo is the Sportforum Hohenschönhausen in Alt-Hohenschönhausen in Berlin. The sports complex is the location of the club offices and the clubhouse.[637] It is also the base of the youth teams.[637] More than 20 youth teams of BFC Dynamo regularly train at the facilities.[682] The Sportforum Hohenschönhausen is considered the spiritual home of the club.[637]\\n\\nThe Sportforum Hohenschönhausen was known as the Dynamo-Sportforum during the East German era.[683] The sports complex was built as a training center for elite sport and was home to sports club SC Dynamo Berlin, with its many departments and squads.[684][685] Development began in 1954 and expansion continued into the 1980s.[686] The Sportforum is still unique as of today.[687] The sports complex covers an area of 45 to 50 hectares and comprises 35 sports facilities as of 2020.[684][687][688][689]\\n\\n\\nA match between SC Dynamo Berlin and SC Turbine Erfurt at the Walter-Ulbricht-Stadion in 1959.\\nSC Dynamo Berlin played its first season at the large Walter-Ulbricht-Stadion in Mitte.[17][690] The team moved its home matches to the football stadium in the Dynamo-Sportforum for the short transitional 1955 season.[691] SC Dynamo Berlin returned to the Walter-Ulbricht-Stadion for the 1956 season.[690] The team would play at the Walter-Ublricht-Stadion for the rest of the 1950s.[690]\\n\\nSC Dynamo Berlin eventually moved its home matches permanentely to the Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum after the construction of the Berlin wall began on 13 August 1961.[17][692] The football stadium in the Dynamo-Sportforum held a capacity of 10,000 spectators at the beginning of the 1961–62 season.[683][nb 8] The team drew average attendances between 3,000 and 6,000 spectators in the DDR-Oberliga at the Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum in the 1960s.[704][705] The highlights were matches against local rival ASK Vorwärts Berlin and the various top teams during the period. The capacity of the football stadium in the Dynamo-Sportforum was gradually expanded during the 1960s.[692][nb 9]\\n\\n\\nA match between BFC Dynamo and BSG Chemie Leipzig at the Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum in 1966.\\nBFC Dynamo began playing occasional matches that required floodlights at the larger Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark in Prenzlauer Berg from November 1968.[692] The Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark was the home ground of FC Vorwärts Berlin at the time. However, the stadium became vacant when FC Vorwärts Berlin was relocated to Frankfurt an der Oder on 31 July 1971.[63] BFC Dynamo played its home matches in the 1971-72 European Cup Winners\' Cup at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark.[708] The matches against Åtvidabergs FF in the quarter-finals on 22 March 1972 and FC Dynamo Moscow in the semi-finals on 5 April 1972 were each attended by 30,000 spectators.[709][710] The team also played two home matches in the 1971-72 DDR-Oberliga at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark.[711] However, more matches at the stadium were not possible after the summer of 1972, as the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark was then undergoing extensive renovation for the upcoming 10th World Festival of Youth and Students.[690]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo was qualified for the 1972-73 UEFA Cup. However, neither the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark nor the Walter-Ulbricht-Stadion were available for the upcoming UEFA Cup matches. Both were undergoing extensive renovation for the 10th World Festival of Youth and Students. Instead, the Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum underwent a complete transformation in just five weeks between the end of July 1972 and September 1972.[690] The capacity of the Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum was now expanded to 20,000 spectators.[712][713][692] BFC Dynamo played all home matches in the 1972-73 UEFA Cup at the Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum. The attendance of 20,000 spectators during the match against Liverpool on 29 November 1972 is still a record attendance for the stadium.[696] BFC Dynamo remained at the Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum for a couple more seasons. The team saw rising attendance numbers at the Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum during the 1970s.[714] An average of 12,000 people attended the last six matches of BFC Dynamo at the Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum in the second half of the 1973–74 season.[692] The match between BFC Dynamo and 1. FC Magdeburg in the 1974-75 DDR-Oberliga at the Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum on 8 March 1975 was attended by a whole 19,000 spectators.[715]\\n\\n\\nA match between BFC Dynamo and SG Dynamo Dresden in front of 25,000 spectators at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark in 1976.[716]\\nBFC Dynamo eventually moved its home matches to the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark for the 1975–76 season, due to upcoming repair work at the Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum.[692] The move was meant to be temporary, but eventually became permanent.[692] The Dynamo-Sportforum would primarily serve as a training facility from then and the football stadium would be used mostly by the reserve team BFC Dynamo II. The Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark held a capacity of 30,00 spectators in the 1975–76 season.[708] The average home attendance of 16,538 spectators for BFC Dynamo at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Stadion in the 1975-76 DDR-Oberliga is the highest average league attendance in club history.[17][717] BFC Dynamo celebrated nine of its ten DDR-Oberliga titles in the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Stadium. The team also played most of its home matches in the UEFA competitions at the stadium. BFC Dynamo hosted teams such as Shakhtar Donetsk, Red Star Belgrade, Nottingham Forest, Hamburger SV, Aston Villa, AS Roma FC Aberdeen at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Stadium in the 1970s and 1980. However, all matches in the derby against 1. FC Union Berlin were played at the neutral Stadion der Weltjugend from the 1976–77 season for security reasons.[294][718][719][720]\\n\\nA permanent training camp for BFC Dynamo was built in Uckley in the Zernsdorf district of Königs Wusterhausen in Bezirk Potsdam at the end of the 1960s.[721] It was located in the woods and completely sealed off from the surroundings.[721][722] The training camp covered an area of around 10 hectares.[722] The complex was equipped with a boarding school, several football pitches, a sports hall, a swimming pool, a fitness area and a sauna.[723][724][725][722][726] The team would gather in Uckley days before its European matches.[17] The players would have access to catering facilities, a nearby lake, a bowling alley, a cinema and pinball machines, among other things.[725][726]\\n\\n\\nThe team of BFC Dynamo in front of the new grandstand of the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark in 1987.\\nBFC Dynamo moved its home matches temporary to the Dynamo-Sportforum for the 1986–87 season, as the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark was undrgoing redevelopment during the season for the upcoming 750th anniversary of Berlin.[692][708] The team also played its home matches in the 1986-87 European Cup at the Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum. The team then returned to the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark for the 1987–88 season.[727] The Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark now had a new four storey grandstand and new floodlight masts. The current grandstand and the floodlights of the stadium dates from this time.[696] The club was rebranded as FC Berlin after Die Wende. FC Berlin moved permanently to the Stadion im Sportforum at the beginning of the 1992–93 season.[696] The team would remain in the Sportforum Hohenschönhausen for many seasons to come.[692]\\n\\nThe capacity of the Stadion im Sportforum had been reduced to about 12,000 spectators by 1992.[692] FC Berlin only drew an average of a couple of hundred spectators per match at the Stadion im Sportforum in the mid-1990s. The highlights were the matches against 1. FC Union Berlin. FC Berlin under Club President Volkmar Wanski announced plans in April 1998 to buy and modernize the stadium.[300] However, the plans eventually failed due to lack of funds. The team saw rising attendance numbers at the Stadion im Sportforum at the end of the 1990s.[714] Active supporters of BFC Dynamo were traditionally found at the northern curved end, popularly known as the Nordwall stand.[717] 4,220 spectators watched the match between BFC Dynamo and Union Berlin at the Stadion im Sportforum on 23 November 1999.[728]\\n\\nSupporters of BFC Dynamo installed new bucket seats on the main stand and built a new clubhouse next to the main stand of the Stadion im Sportforum in 2002–2003.[729] The Stadion im Sportforum was then equipped with a 25-metre player tunnel and plexiglass-clad coaching benches in November 2004.[730] BFC Dynamo made new plans for a modern football stadium in the Sportforum Hohenschönhausen in 2006 under Club President Mario Weinkauf. The club now wanted to build a new modern stadium for 10,000–15,000 spectators.[731] However, these plans did not materialize either. The Stadion im Sportforum was closed at the end of the 2005–06 season following the riots during the match between BFC Dynamo and Union Berlin on 13 May 2006.[457] BFC Dynamo temporarily had to move to the Friedrich-Ludwg-Jahn-Sportpark.[461] The stadium was then refurbished in 2006–2007 to increase safety and meet the requirements of the NOFV.[487] The refurbishment included a new fence.[732]\\n\\n\\nA match between BFC Dynamo and SV Babelsberg 03 on 23 April 2017.\\nBFC Dynamo won promotion to the Regionalliga Nordost at the end of the 2013–14 season. The team moved permanently to the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark for the 2014–15 season, due to increased media and spectator interest following its promotion.[696][733] The 2014-15 Regionalliga Nordost meant matches against well-known opponents such as 1. FC Magdeburg and FC Carl Zeiss Jena. The more central location of the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark was seen by the club as an opportunity to attract more spectators.[733] The match between BFC Dynamo and 1. FC Magdeburg on 8 November 2014 was attended by 5,103 spectators.[734] Active supporters of BFC Dynamo have traditionally been found on the main stand, and on the side opposite the main stand (German: die Gegengerade) of the Friedrich Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark.[717] The match between BFC Dynamo and FC Schalke 04 in the first round of the 2018-19 DFB-Pokal at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark on 17 August 2017 was watched by 14,117 spectators.[570] The attendance was the highest attendance for BFC Dynamo since the fall of the Berlin wall.[570][86] The average league attendance of BFC Dynamo in the 2017-18 Regionalliga Nordost would also be the highest average league attendance of BFC Dynamo since the 1990-91 season.[705]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo had to play a number of matches at the Stadion im Sportforum at the end of the 2018–19 season due to safety issues relating to the dilapidated floodlights at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark.[735] The move was greeted by some supporters as a move to the true home of the club.[736] The club was then set to return to the Sportforum in the 2020–21 season as the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark was planned to be demolished for a complete redevelopment.[637] The team was allowed to continue play in the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark until 31 December 2020.[737] BFC Dynamo then officially announced on 21 March 2021 that the club was going to move back to the Sportforum Hohenschönhausen for the next season.[738]\\n\\nThe Stadion im Sportforum was equipped with a floodlight system in April 2021.[739][740] The club organized a work effort in the summer of 2021 to get the stadium in shape for the upcoming Regionalliga season. [741] Supporters of BFC Dynamo gathered and cleared sections of the old stadium from weeds.[742] Members of the interest group IG BFC\'er also restored the iconic manual scoreboard above the curved end towards the Weißenseer Weg in time for the first home match of the 2021–22 season against Energie Cottbus on 28 July 2021.[743] The attendance for BFC Dynamo at the Stadion im Sportforum in the 2021-22 Regionalliga Nordost was almost tripled compared to the last comparable league season before the COVID-19 pandemic. 3,219 people watched the match between BFC Dynamo and FC Carl Zeiss Jena on 10 April 2022.[744]\\n\\nFuture stadium\\nThe large stadium in the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark is planned to be demolished towards the end of 2023 for a complete redevelopment.[745] The new stadium im the Fredrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark is designed as an inclusive sports facility. The stadium will hold 20,000 spectators and meet the requirements for play in the 3. Liga and 2. Bundesliga.[746][747][745] BFC Dynamo will be able to play matches at the new stadium. The new stadium in the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark is planned to be opened in 2028.[748]\\n\\nSupporters\\nEast German era\\nBFC Dynamo played only a minor role in football in Berlin until the relocation of FC Vorwärts Berlin to Frankfurt an der Oder in 1971.[717] The club initially had modest support, but with its growing successes in the 1970s, the club began to attract young fans, primarily from the central areas around the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark, such as Prenzlauer Berg and Mitte.[174] Many came from working class families in Prenzlauer Berg.[749] One of the first big supporter groups of BFC Dynamo was Black Eagle. The fan club was founded in 1972 and was one of the earliest fan clubs in East German football. Fans of BFC Dynamo were the first to sew their embroidered fan club badges on their jackets. This was a novelty among football supporters in East Germany in the 1970s.[750]\\n\\nThe supporter scene became a focal point for various subcultures in the late 1970s and beginning of the 1980s.[751][520][752] There were punks, rockers, hippies and a few early skinheads.[751][717][753][754][137] Some were left-leaning and others were right-leaning.[751][754] Football and stadium life offered free spaces that were difficult for the authorities to control.[137] For some fans, being part of the supporter scene was an opportunity to rebel against the East German regime.[751] Most supporters of BFC Dynamo had little to do with the state. It was more important for them to protest, do their own thing and break out from everyday life.[717] Despite cheering for a club associated with the Stasi, supporters of BFC Dynamo were not loyal to the line.[751] Many active fans of BFC Dynamo in the 1980s were against the regime.[177][754] Some supporters would even cut out the \\\"D\\\" for SV Dynamo from their club patches. They considered the \\\"BFC\\\" to be free from the Stasi, while they thought the \\\"D\\\" symbolized the exact opposite.[755]\\n\\n\\\"We provoked with chants and slogans. We were right, left, punk, hippie, skinhead. We were direct and provocative, kind and evil, in love, or drunk. Cool words were always well received. Right or left, I don\'t want to classify one. We were all in our fan group against the GDR, rebellion!\\\"\\n\\n– A fan of BFC Dynamo in the 1980s[756]\\nYoung people were gradually attracted by the provocative image of the club: its successes, its reputation as a Stasi club and the hatred of opposing fans.[520][752] Some fans of BFC Dynamo found delight in the unpopularity of their club and took pride in the hatred they met.[754][757][32] One fan recalled that the 1980s \\\"were my greatest years, as we always had glorious success in provoking other fans\\\" and another one that \\\"we were really hated by everyone\\\".[757] Fans of BFC Dynamo would sometimes respond to the hatred they met by singing chants in praise of Erich Mielke as a provocation.[758] They would also throw tropical fruits, that were only available in East Berlin, at home fans during away matches in Saxony.[178][753]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo came to be associated with areas such as Prenzlauer Berg, Pankow, Weißensee, Hohenschönhausen and certain cafés and restaurants in vicinity of Alexanderplatz.[759][760] The supporter scene included groups such as Black Eagle, Norbert Trieloff, Bobbys, Iron Fist, Beatles BFC Club, Die Ratten, Berliner Wölfe, Heavy Horses, Black Pahnter and Madness boys of Preussen in the 1980s.[761] Fashion played a big role in the BFC Dynamo supporter scene.[32][754] Football supporters in East Berlin shared a sense of superiority over their counterparts in the regional districts.[760][751] This was also the case with the supporters of Union Berlin, but notably with the supporters of BFC Dynamo.[760][762][177][763]\\n\\nFootball-related violence spread in East Germany in the 1970s.[137][764] The supporter scene of BFC Dynamo was still young at the time, while clubs such Union Berlin and BSG Chemie Leipzig had large followings.[32] A trip to Leipzig or Dresden was a difficult task.[717] Supporters of BFC Dynamo responded to the hostile environment, and learned to compensate their smaller numbers, by being more aggressive and better organized.[765][174][32][766] The dislike against BFC Dynamo in stadiums around the country and the hatred of opposing fans welded its supporters together.[767] One fan of BFC Dynamo said: \\\"This feeling of being hated is what makes it so appealing.\\\" A saying among the supporters of BFC Dynamo was: \\\"We are few, but we are awesome!\\\" (German: Wir sind wenig, wir sind geil!)[768][32] One fan of BFC Dynamo recalled: \\\"It was really rumbling at away trips, and only then you felt your own strength. When we went with 200 people against 1,000 Unioners and you noticed: If you stick together, you have an incredible amount of violence.\\\"[769] Supporters of BFC Dynamo would eventually gain a reputation for being particularly violent and organized.[174] One fan of Union Berlin recalled: \\\"There was hardly an enemy mob against us, we were just too many... But the people who stood in the way of the violence-seeking BFC:ers were very few... The BFC:ers were completely organized. These hundred and fifty people, everyone knew each other. They stood as a block like a wall.\\\"[770] The book \\\"Riot Boys!\\\" by Jochen Schramm depicts the supporter scene of BFC Dynamo and contains stories of violent away trips in the early 1980s. Jochen \\\"Ellis\\\" Schramm was a member of the hooligan scene of BFC Dynamo in the 1980s.[771]\\n\\nThe development in the supporter scene of BFC Dynamo would eventually catch the attention of the authorities. The Stasi conducted a study on the violent structures of the supporter scene at the beginning of the 1980s. It found that 80 percent of those committing violent acts were 16–25 years old. Most of them were workers or students.[760] It also found that 20 percent came from families of the socialist intelligentia.[177][760] The Stasi assigned a group of two full-time officers from the district administration to the supporter scene during 1982–83 season.[772] From then, supporters of BFC Dynamo were accompanied, observed and documented.[773] This was a measure that had previously also been applied to the supporter scene of Union Berlin.[178] The authorities had allegedly been particularly alarmed when supporters of BFC Dynamo unfurled a poster in memory of Lutz Eigendorf with the text \\\"Iron Foot, we mourn you!\\\" during a match at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark in April 1983.[774][773][174] Supporters had also started a fan club in honour of Eigendorf.[753] The Stasi would try to control the supporter scene with a broad catalogue of measures: persistent talks, intimidation attempts, reporting requirements and arrests.[717][751] It would also attempt to infiltrate the fan clubs by unofficial collaborators (IM).[772] All football fan clubs in East Germany had to undergo registration.[137] According to Stasi information, BFC Dynamo had six registered fan clubs and 22 unauthorized fan clubs in 1986. Unauthorized fan clubs were those that were unregistered or did not meet DFV guidelines.[775] East German state television always tryied to hide riots from viewers. But the sound recording from football matches was the biggest problem. Additional sound systems were integrated into the stadium of BFC Dynamo for radio and television broadcasts. The system was also supposed to drown out shouts and chanting from the violent structures, so that television viewers and radio listeners would not hear anything.[776]\\n\\nThe supporter scene of BFC Dynamo came to be increasingly associated with skinheads and far-right tendencies from the mid-1980s.[174] More and more supporters of BFC Dynamo began to embrace skinhead fashion in the early 1980s.[751][717] Skinhead fashion was now considered the most provocative outfit.[751] By the mid-1980s, the club had become one of the most popular football clubs in the growing skinhead movement.[32][nb 10] The reputation of BFC Dynamo as the hated Stasi club also attracted skinheads, who used the club as a stage for their provocations.[520] Right-wing slogans and fascist chants were considered as the most challenging provocations, as anti-fascism was state doctrine and Nazism officially did not exist in East Germany.[783][137][174][751][784][637] For young people, being a Nazi was sometimes considered the sharpest form of opposition.[785] However, instances of Nazi provocations did not necessarily reflect genuine political convictions. At least some part of the \\\"drift to the right\\\" among East German youth during the 1980s was rooted in a desire to position oneself wherever the state was not.[786] One fan of BFC Dynamo said: \\\"None of us really knew anything about politics. But to raise your arm in front of the Volkspolizei was a real kick. You did that and for some of them, their whole world just fell apart\\\".[787][717][174][nb 11]\\n\\nThe first East German hooligan group developed from the supporter scene of BFC Dynamo in the 1980s. The development was partly a response to the increasing state repression against the supporter scene, notably from the Stasi.[190] An organized hooligan scene with groups, structures and training rooms, that was unique in East Germany, would eventually emerge at BFC Dynamo.[766] The hooligans of BFC Dynamo initially reacted with restraint to police intervention in the fan block. There was a risk of going to jail. However, the Volkspolizei were sometimes ruthless, especially at away matches. Towards the end of the 1980s, there was an uprising and the hooligans of BFC Dynamo now began to confront the police with violence.[794] The final of the 1987-88 FDGB-Pokal between BFC Dynamo and Carl Zeiss Jena on 4 June 1988 saw some of the most serious violence ever witnessed at an East German football match.[4] A group of 100 to 150 skinheads and other hooligans marched through Pankow to the Stadion der Weltjugend for the match. They chanted fascist slogans and clashed with other supporters.[795][779] Riots then broke out in one of the blocks shortly before the end of the match. Supporters destroyed fences and threw seats at match stewards.[796] A group of 300 supporters of BFC Dynamo attempted to invade the pitch during the victory ceremony. They caused extensive damage to 60 seating benches.[786] About a year later, supporters of BFC Dynamo would also destroy large parts of a block of the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark, during the match against AS Monaco in the 1989–90 European Cup Winners\' Cup on 1 November 1989.[797][798][nb 12]\\n\\nGerman reunification\\nA wave of violence swept through the football stadiums of East Germany in 1990.[178] The collapse of the East German regime resulted in a security vacuum.[800][801][802] The Volkspolizei was overwhelmed by the amount of disorder and often reluctant to use enough force, due to the political situation.[803][178][804][264]\\n\\n\\nSupporters of FC Berlin during the away match against FC Carl Zeiss Jena on 8 April 1990.\\nMasked supporters of FC Berlin rioted in central Jena before the away match against FC Carl Zeiss Jena in the 1989-90 DDR-Oberliga on 8 April 1990. They broke shop windows, smashed windscreens of police vehicles with stones and left a trail of destruction in the city center. Supporters of FC Berlin also fired flares at police officers during the match.[805] The disorder at the stadium would not cease and the match was eventually interrupted.[32] The riots in Jena caught rare attention by East German state media, which until then had been generally silent about football related disorder.[32][751]\\n\\n\\nA flare thrown on the pitch during the match between FC Carl Zeiss Jena and FC Berlin on 8 April 1990.\\nThere were now riots now after every home match in FC Berlin. After the last home match in the 1989-90 NOFV-Oberliga against BSG Wismut Aue on 26 May 1990, a group of 300 supporters of FC Berlin marched from Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark towards Alexanderplatz. Windows were smashed, cars were damaged and a minibus was overturned as they made their way. Supporters met at the Marx-Engels-Forum. A group of 200 people then formed a human swastika in front of the Volkspolizei. There were 21 arrests, and the police seized knives, knuckle dusters and pepper spray.[806]\\n\\nHooligans who had left East Germany for various reasons in recent years rejoined the hooligan scene after the opening of the Berlin Wall.[265][807] Some were former skinheads who had been deported by the Stasi to West Germany in the late 1980s. Now they chanted things such as \\\"Who should be our Führer? Erich Mielke!\\\" as a provocative fun, to the dismay of the club.[265][804] Supporters who returned from West Germany also brought back a new fashion based on designer clothing labels and expensive sportswear, which was adopted by the supporter scene.[265][767] While combat boots and bomber jackets were now common at many places in East Germany, some supporters of BFC Dynamo wanted to differentiate themselves. Expensive sneakers was now the new fashion in the supporter scene.[717][807][808] Brands such as Diesel, Iceberg, Chevignon, Adidas, Best Company, New Balance and Ray Ban became popular.[767][265][808][760]\\n\\nThe reputation of the hooligans of FC Berlin attracted a large number of new young people who joined the hooligan scene.[265] A series of violence occurred in connection with the cup match between Union Berlin and FC Berlin in the Second round of the 1990-91 FDGB-Pokal on 23 September 1990. Hooligans of FC Berlin stormed the home stands of the Stadion an der Alten Försterei armed with clubs and flares and hunted down supporters of Union Berlin.[263][809] Riots broke out after match. Aound 250 hooligans threw gravel and other objects at the police. At least 14 police officers were injured in the clashes.[810] Serious riots then continued in the city, involving hundreds of supporters. Street battles broke out in areas of East Berlin, even spreading to Kreuzberg in West Berlin.[811] One supporter of FC Berlin said: \\\"In 1990, thanks to the many departures to the West, it became clear relatively quickly that there was no flowerpot to be won with the current team. We then turned our attention to other things.\\\"[812]\\n\\nHooligans in East Germany unleashed almost unbridled violence against the representatives of the disintegrating East German state.[802] Violent riots had occurred in Rostock, Dresden, Erfurt and East Berlin.[802] Police had been forced to shoot warning shots during violent riots in Leipzig and one match in the 1990-91 NOFV-Oberliga had already been abandoned due to riots in the stadium.[803][813][814][815][nb 13] The situation peaked during a match between FC Sachsen Leipzig and FC Berlin on 3 November 1990. Supporters of FC Berlin travelled in large numbers to Leipzig for the match.[802] The police had only 219 officers available for the match.[264] There were clashes at the Leipzig main railway station, with one police officer injured and 50 supporters taken into custody.[264][816] A first group of around 100 supporters of FC Berlin entered the Georg-Schwarz-Sportpark in time for kick-off.[802] They were joined by a hooligans of 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig, who had forced their way into the stadium.[817][818][819][777] Supporters of both camps tried to attack each other in the stadium and the police had difficulties in maintaining a buffer zone.[264] A second group of up to 400 supporters of FC Berlin arrived later at the nearby Leipzig-Leutzsch S-Bahn station at Am Ritterschlößchen street.[802][264] Fireworks were fired as they made their way to the stadium.[820] The group was blocked from entering the stadium by police equipped with helmets and shields, despite showing valid tickets.[821][822][265] The supporters were not given any reason.[820] They were then pushed back by the police using tear gas and truncheons.[802][264][821] The group returned to the S-Bahn station and made an attempt to reach the stadium from the Pettenkofer Straße instead.[802] They were again blocked by police who immediately used truncheons.[802][820]\\n\\nRiots broke out at the S-Bahn station.[802] The station building was vandalized and numerous cars were smashed or burned, including at least one W 50 police truck and one police car.[802][264][820][816] The police was allegedly outnumbered.[823][nb 14] Cobblestones were thrown at the police waiting at the Pettenkofer Straße.[802] The police now decided to use their firearms.[802] 18-year old supporter Mike Polley (de) from the locality of Malchow in Berlin was hit by several bullets and instantly killed.[265][807] He was allegedly about to bend down to a friend when hit.[826] Several others were injured and at least another three people were seriously injured.[801][264][821] One supporter of FC Berlin was hit in the head and suffered critical injuries, but survived.[265] The police had fired between 50 and 100 shots in about a minute, from 11 different police pistols.[264][821] Reports and sources vary on what happened on the scene and how the situation was.[264] The police claim that they were surrounded.[823] But this was rebuffed by an eyewitness.[820] Shots had been fired from distances as long as 30–40 meters.[264][820] The police had also fired at fleeing supporters.[820] One supporter was hit while trying to escape into an S-Bahn train.[820] Not every injured had come with the supporters of FC Berlin. Also an uninvolved woman was shot in the leg.[264]\\n\\nAfter the shootings, some supporters of FC Berlin left the S-Bahn station by train.[823] Many were shaken, but other wanted to take revenge.[820] A group of supporters stopped a tram, kicked the driver out and maneuvered it down town.[265][802] Riots now continued in central Leipzig, where policed presence was low.[820] The riots in central Leipzig continued for several hours and the damage was extensive.[265][802][777] Supporters of FC Berlin devastated entire streets.[823] All shop windows on the Nikolaistraße opposite the main railway station were broken.[816] There was rampage at the Park Hotel.[818][824] The ground floor of a department store on Brühl was destroyed.[824] Numerous cars were demolished and up to 31 shops were smashed and looted.[824][823][264] Supporters clashed with transport police at the main railway station. New shots were fired by the police, but no one was injured.[823][265][264]\\n\\n\\nSupporters of FC Berlin commemorate Mike Polley at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark, during the match against HFC Chemie in the 1990-91 NOFV-Oberliga on 10 November 1990.\\nMike Polley was considered a beginner in the supporter scene.[823] A demonstration against police violence with 1,000 participants was arranged in Prenzlauer Berg by supporters of FC Berlin after the match against HFC Chemie on 10 November 1990.[32][264][777] The demonstration was supported by the recently founded Fanprojekt Berlin.[264] Also professional FC Berlin players such as Waldemar Ksienzyk participated in the march.[257] The demonstration received support from politicians such as Lena Schraut from the Alternative List and from left-wing activists, notably from the occupied houses near Senefelderplatz at the Schönhauser Allee.[777][265] The friendly match between East Germany and West Germany that was planned to be held on the Zentralstadion in Leipzig on 21 November 1990 was cancelled for security reasons and due to the tense situation among football supporters after the shootings.[264][777] An investigation against ten police officers was opened, but closed in April 1992.[264][777] The exact circumstances around the death of Mike Polley were never fully clarified.[822][827]\\n\\nStadium attendance collapsed in 1990. Many supporters of BFC Dynamo stopped attending matches after the Peaceful revolution, as the best players were sold off to clubs in West Germany, sports performance slumped, tickets prices rose, mass unemployment spread and hooligans had come to dominate the stands.[178][801][637][828] Some shifted their focus to ice hockey instead.[829] The average league attendance of the 1990–91 NOFV-Oberliga was by far the lowest in the league history.[801] BFC Dynamo was hit particularly hard by the decline. Average league attendance at BFC Dynamo had dropped from 8,385 in the 1988–89 season to 1,076 in the 1990–91 season.[830][831][832] Ordinary supporters had disappeared. Only young supporters remained in the stadium at FC Berlin in 1990 and 1991.[178]\\n\\nThe violent faction of FC Berlin would come to shape the entire 1990–91 season.[265] Matches involving FC Berlin were all security matches.[264] A group of 500–600 supporters of FC Berlin travelled with a special train to Rostock for an away match against F.C. Hansa Rostock on 16 March 1991.[265][833] The police did not manage to control the situation despite a record strong presence of more than 600 officers.[833][834] Riots broke out in central Rostock, where supporters smashed shops, demolished cars and attacked people.[265][767][833] Supporters without tickets stormed the Ostseestadion and there were fights with supporters of F.C. Hansa Rostock around the stadium.[833] Riots at the train station after the match had to be suppressed by the police with tear gas and water cannons.[833][265] The damage was again extensive. Up to 17 shops at the Wismarischen Straße were smashed and looted, the train station was devastated and the special train was vandalized.[834] 21 people were injured in the clashes, including nine police officers.[835][836] The damages amounted to around 750,000 Deutsche Marks.[836] The Minister President of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern Alfred Gomolka believed the Stasi was behind the riots. He claimed that the hooligans of FC Berlin were controlled by \\\"Stasi remnants\\\" who wanted to cause \\\"destabilization\\\". Also the Interior Minister of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern Georg Diederich saw the riots as a political confrontation. As a proof, they pointed to the fact that supporters of FC Berlin came with East German flags and that the club had pre-financed the special train to Rostock.[835]\\n\\nThe youth television programme Elf99 on Deutscher Fernsehfunk (DFF) ran a special story on the hooligans of FC Berlin in August 1991. The story was called \\\"Elf-Spezial: Das randalierende Rätsel – Der Berliner Hooligans zwischen Wahn und Scham?\\\" and can be found on YouTube as of 2020.[837] About 200 supporters of FC Berlin traveled to the top match against Greifswalder SC 1926 in the 1991-92 NOFV-Oberliga Nord on 3 November 1991. Repeated riots broke out during the match. Supporters of FC Berlin claim they were insulted as \\\"Stasi-pigs!\\\" by spectators in Greifswald. Supporters of FC Berlin fought with other spectators and the stadium facilities were demolished in the riots.[838] Up to 100 hooligans of FC Berlin also attacked an asylum shelter that was located right next to the stadium in Greifswald.[839][840][788][841] SV Hafen Rostock 61 subsequently postponed its upcoming league match at home against FC Berlin for security reasons.[842][841]\\n\\nHooliganism\\nThe hooligan scene of FC Berlin at the beginning of the 1990s was considered the most notorious for years in Germany. Hooligans of FC Berlin were subsequently involved in numerous fights in stadiums, woods and meadows.[178] Organized fights with other hooligan groups began in 1992 and 1993.[265] However, hooligans of FC Berlin were also involved in fights with squatters and other left-wing groups in the 1990s.[265] 25 supporters of FC Berlin fought 40 people from the left-wing scene in front of a pub on the Straße der Pariser Kommune in Friedrichshain on 17 April 1995. Several people were injured.[843] A number of people allegedly associated with the hooligan scene of FC Berlin attacked formerly occupied houses and a meeting point for left-wing football supporters at Brunnenstraße 6 and 7 in Mitte on the night of 6 September 1997. A punk concert was held on the premises at the time. Four people had to be hospitalized with injuries.[844]\\n\\nIn the years after German reunification, the club\'s eternal outside image attracted people from the underground.[752] Playing for meager crowds in regional leagues, the club eventually became a meeting place for individuals from Berlin\'s far-right, hooligan and criminal underground.[637][845] By the mid-1990s, the hooligan scene of FC Berlin had developed a connection to the eastern Berlin bouncer scene.[387] The eastern Berlin bouncer scene would eventually be almost completely organized from the hooligan scene of BFC Dynamo.[799][846] One of those involved in the assault on French policeman Daniel Nivel during the 1998 FIFA World Cup had connections to the hooligan scene of FC Berlin.[637] The same man was later linked to organized crime and eventfully involved in a high-profile drug trafficking case.[847][848][637]\\n\\nThe match between BFC Dynamo and Berlin Türkspor 1965 in the final of the 1998–99 Berlin Cup on 11 May 1999 was marked by violence. Supporters of BFC Dynamo directed far-right chants and others provocations against Berlin Türkspor 1965 during the match.[849] 400 supporters of BFC Dynamo invaded the pitch after the final whistle to celebrate the title. Some supporters also attacked players of Berlin Türkspor 1965. Two players of Berlin Türkspor 1965 were injured, one of them had suffered a stab wound.[850] BFC Dynamo Club President Volkmar Wanski was able to prevent a total escalation by giving a calming speech over the stadium microphone.[851] He immediately apologized for the behavior of the supporters at the press conference after the match.[850] Older supporters of BFC Dynamo openly expressed their contempt for the far-right supporters that had visited the match.[852] BFC Dynamo and Berlin Türkspor 1965 agreed to meet in a friendly match later in the season and to organize a joint meal for players and responsible.[853] Wanski made it clear in the speakers ahead of the last home match against FC Rot-Weiß Erfurt in the 1998-99 Regionalliga Nordost on 15 May 1999 that \\\"anyone who cannot behave has no business in our stadium\\\".[854]\\n\\nSerious riots broke out in Prenzlauer Berg after the match between BFC Dynamo and 1. FC Union Berlin in the Round of 16 of the 2000–01 Berlin Cup at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark on 24 March 2001. Around 150 supporters of BFC Dynamo attacked the police after the match, as they wanted to storm the block of Union Berlin.[855][342] Around 500 supporters of BFC Dynamo then attacked police at Eberswalder Straße.[342] The police employed water cannons against supporters at Eberswalder Straße and Schönhauser Allee. Nine people, including four police officers, were injured.[855][342] BFC Dynamo Club President Karin Halsch (de) and 1. FC Union Berlin Club President Heiner Bertram criticized the police in unison for provocations during the match and for triggering riots.[341] Karin Halsch simultaneously expressed sadness that the riots destroyed a lot of reconstruction work in the club and announced that there would be many stadium bans.[341][856] Also coach Jürgen Bogs spoke out about \\\"senseless violence\\\" that would once again fall back on the club, but also criticized the police for provocations.[341] Many of those involved in the riots did not come from the supporter scene of BFC Dynamo. Many were visitors from other cities in Germany.[387]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo had the highest number of violent supporters in Germany in 2005.[857] Violence broke out during the match between Tennis Borussia Berlin and BFC Dynamo in the 2004-05 NOFV-Oberliga Nord at the Mommsenstadion on 11 February 2005. A flare was lit and a couple of bangers set off in the guest block at the beginning of the second half. Police then decided to intervene against away supporters. Police officers were pelted with beer cups and attacked by supporters of BFC Dynamo when they entered gest block. Eight police officers were injured and 11 supporters of BFC Dynamo arrested. BFC Dynamo criticized the police operation as \\\"disproportionate\\\".[858][431] Supporters of BFC Dynamo claimed that they had been called \\\"Nazis\\\", \\\"Ossis\\\" and \\\"Unioners\\\" by police officers. Riots had broken out also when Tennis Borussia Berlin played 1. FC Union Berlin in round of 16 of the 2004-05 Berlin Cup at the Mommsenstadion a couple of weeks before.[431]\\n\\nFighting between supporters of BFC Dynamo and police again broke out in connection with the match between BFC Dynamo and SV Yeşilyurt at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark on 24 April 2005. The mood had been tense during the match. The situation escalated when celebrating supporters of BFC Dynamo attacked the fence after the final whistle. Police intervened with water hoses, batons and tear gas against supporters of BFC Dynamo. Four police officers were injured and five hooligans arrested. One police officer suffered a broken nose and another one a concussion.[859][860] Riots again broke out in connection to a match between BFC Dynamo and SV Yeşilyurt at the opening of the 2005-06 NOFV-Oberliga Nord at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark 5 August 2005. The match was attended by 1,200 supporters of BFC Dynamo. Hooligans in the crowd threw bottles and stones at police officers during the match. Fights between hooligans and police then broke out after match. Around 150 hooligans had participated in the riots, according to police information.[861][438] BFC Dynamo spokesperson Yiannis Kaufmann claimed that those involved were a \\\"mob of travelling fans who wants to cause trouble everywhere and now discredit the BFC\\\".[861] As many as 13 police officers were injured in the riots.[439][440]\\n\\n\\nThe Stadion im Sportforum on 14 May 2006.\\nPolice made a controversial raid against the discotheque Jeton in Friedrichshain where supporters of BFC Dynamo and other people had gathered to celebrate in connection to a fan tournament in memory of Mike Polley on the night of 20 August 2005. The fan tournament had been visited by numerous teams, including teams from FC St. Pauli, 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig, Aberdeen F.C., VfL Bochum and Malmö FF.[862][863][864] The large-scale police operation involved 300 officers, including 100 members of the SEK.[865][866][867] 158 persons were arrested. Among the detainees were 19 Category C-supporters and 22 Category B-supporters.[439][866] Supporters filed numerous complaints against the police for use of excessive violence.[868] 39 people at the discotheque were injured.[440] Also bystanders were affected.[440] Police initially claimed they had been pelted with bottles and furnishings, but later corrected their statement and admitted that there had been no resistance.[865][440][439] The police had allegedly beaten defenseless people.[869] Police stated that the raid was a preventative measure on short notice to prevent hooligans from organizing for the upcoming match against Union Berlin on 21 August 2005.[440][866] There were speculations that police also took revenge for riots during the match between BFC Dynamo and SV Yeşilyurt at the opening of the season.[440][439] More than 1,000 police officers were deployed to the derby and the match was played without crowd trouble.[866][867] Banners in solidarity with the supporters of BFC Dynamo were displayed in 17 football stadiums across Germany during the following matchdays.[870]\\n\\nThe return match between BFC Dynamo and Union Berlin in the 2005–06 NOFV-Oberliga Nord was played at the Stadion im Sportforum on 13 May 2006. The standing was 1–1 when supporters of BFC Dynamo invaded the pitch in an attempt to storm the block of Union Berlin around the 75th minute.[871] Supporters of Union Berlin fled in panic.[872] The match was abandoned and Union Berlin was awarded a 2–0 win.[871][873] The players of BFC Dynamo wore the motto \\\"No power of violence\\\" on their shirts in the following match against BFC Preussen away on 17 May 2006.[874] The Stadion im Sportforum was temporarily closed for matches in the NOFV-Oberliga Nord after the riots.[457] The riots during the match against 1. FC Union Berlin threw the club into a financial crisis. Treasurer Sven Radicke concluded: \\\"Four years of our work were ruined in five minutes\\\".[459]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo has often attracted hooligans from outside, and hooligans who are otherwise not involved in the supporter scene, to high-profile matches.[520][875][530] The club has repeatedly complained about so-called \\\"riot tourists\\\".[530][876] Riots broke out after the match against Berliner AK 07 in the final of the 2009–10 Berlin Cup at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark on 2 June 2010. Around 100–150 supporters of BFC Dynamo attempted to invade the pitch after the final whistle.[519][875] Match stewards and players of BFC Dynamo threw themselves in to restrain supporters and prevent further riots.[519][877][875][520] One of them was goalkeeper Nico Thomaschewski, who later received an award from the Berlin Football Association (BFV) for his actions.[875] Polish fans of Pogoń Szczecin were allegedly linked to the riots.[875] Those who had invaded the pitch were whistled by other supporters of BFC Dynamo when they returned to the stands.[878]\\n\\nMajor riots then occurred after the match against 1. FC Kaiserslautern in the first round of the 2011-12 DFB-Pokal at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark on 3 July 2011.[528][529] Around 200–300 supporters of BFC Dynamo invaded the buffer zone and stormed the guest block after the match.[530][520] 18 police officers and many supporters from Kaiserslautern were injured in the attack.[520] The Chairman of the Economic Council Peter Meyer openly expressed his embarrassment and disappointment over the behavior of some supporters and publicly apologized.[530] There were allegations that hooligans outside the BFC Dynamo environment had been involved.[530] While the police stated that most of those arrested were from Berlin, the club claimed it had never seen most of the recent perpetrators before.[520]\\n\\nThe contemporary supporter scene\\nThe contemporary supporter scene contains various subcultures and categories of supporters. It ranges from older supporters to younger ultras.[749] Older supporters constitute an essential part of the supporter scene.[752] Many are active in the supporter group 79er.[875] The group is credited for its commitment to the club, notably the youth teams. Its members have been supporters of BFC Dynamo since the late 1970s.[875][717]\\n\\nThe supporter scene played an important part in saving the club from bankruptcy in 2001.[637] Supporters organized a demonstration against the impending bankruptcy. The demonstration marched from the Sportforum to the Rotes Rathaus where it was met by the former club president and SPD politician Karin Halsch.[368][369] Supporters threw parties and organized collections, made donations and travelled to countries such as Austria and Switzerland to convince creditors to accept smaller pay-offs in order to save the cub.[637] Supporters also installed bucket seats at the Stadion im Sportforum and built a new clubhouse in the Sportforum during the insolvency.[729][879] The insolvency crisis remains a defining moment for older supporters.[637] The supporter scene has traditionally arranged an annual Mike-Polley-Gedenkturnier, which is a football fan tournament in memory of Mike Polley.[822][880] The first edition of the fan tournament was arranged in the Sportforum Hohenschönhausen in 2003 and comprised 28 teams.[881] A march in memory of Mike Polley in Leipzig in 2018 was attended by 850 supporters of BFC Dynamo.[882]\\n\\nNew groups of younger ultra-oriented supporters have emerged since the 2000s.[875][717] Supporter group Fraktion H was founded in 2006 by younger supporters who wanted to create more atmosphere in the stadium.[875][717] A minor ultras scene then emerged with the founding of supporter group Ultras BFC in 2011. The ultras of BFC Dynamo have initiated campaigns such as \\\"Brown is not Claret\\\" and have also engaged in football tournaments for refugees.[845][717][883][608] The club has encouraged the new groups of younger supporters and club management has taken a stand against racism and right-wing extremism.[884][883][608] Fraktion H maintains a friendship with the supporters of Eintracht Trier, while members of the now dissolved Ultras BFC have had contacts with the ultras of Swedish football club GAIS.[885]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo is affiliated with Fanprojekt Berlin, which is an independent organization that engages in socio-pedagogical fan work.[752][886] The organization supports young fans in various aspects of life and aims at promoting a positive supporter culture.[886] BFC Dynamo engages in active fan work and has taken measures to control violent elements, to exclude known violators and to distance itself from radical supporters.[752][530][883] Far-right symbols and slogans are not tolerated by the club.[752] The Chairman of the Economic Council, Peter Meyer, stated publicly in connection with a friendly match against Hertha BSC in 2007 that the club did not want people who cannot follow the rules and that \\\"anyone who shouts Nazi slogans will be thrown out of the stadium\\\".[495] Lawyer and former Vice President of BFC Dynamo René Lau said in an interview with Deutsche Welle in 2019: \\\"If you had asked me 25 years ago [if BFC had a problem with Nazis], I would have said yes. But is today\'s BFC Dynamo a Nazi club? I would vehemently dispute that.\\\"[637] A large number of stadium bans has been issued by the club since the mid-2000s.[887][530] A total of 40 stadium bans was issued only in 2006.[888][887] No riots has occurred since 2011.[752]\\n\\nThe contemporary supporter scene has includes groups such as 79er, Mythos BFC, Fraktion H, Piefkes, Ultras BFC, East Company, Riot Sport, Black Boys Dynamo, Bärenbande, Gegengerade, Hipstercrew, Märkische Jungs, Sektion Süddeutschland and Banda Invicta.[875][889][717][890] Supporter group Gegengerade is a left wing-oriented fan club.[890] A number of supporters BFC Dynamo had been members of the \\\"Anti-Fascist Football Fan Initiative\\\" (AFFI) aleady back in 1993.[891][892] Supporters of BFC Dynamo have occasionally displayed a Norwegian flag with the text \\\"Thanks Norway\\\", in memory of Norway\'s 2–0 win over Nazi Germany in the quarter-finals of the 1936 Summer Olympics. Another banner that has occasionally been displayed at the stadium contains the text \\\"There Is A Light That Never Goes Out\\\", with reference to the 1980s British cult band The Smiths.[893]\\n\\nUltras BFC announced its dissolution on 23 January 2023, after the group had lost essential material in an attack. An individual in the group was attacked by a group of people in front of his private residence and robbed of essential group material. The group apologized to the supporter scene of BFC Dynamo and consequently dissolved, but at the same time announced that this was not the end.[894] The attack has been traced to Cottbus.[895] A new supporter group named Banda Invicta eventually presented itself with a banner and a coreography on the first matchday of the 2023-24 Regionalliga Nordost on 29 July 2023. The coreography read \\\"On to a new chapter\\\".[896]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo had 100 Category C and 190 Category-B supporters in 2019.[897] Younger hooligans of BFC Dynamo have contacts with supporter group Kaliber 030 at Hertha.[637][898] 20–25 supporters of BFC Dynamo joined Hertha in the guest block of the Stadion an der Alten Försterei during the derby between Union Berlin and Hertha on 2 November 2019.[899] Older hooligans of BFC Dynamo, on the other hand, maintain friendly relationships with like-minded supporters of 1. FC Magdeburg.[637] Supporters of BFC Dynamo wanted to travel in numbers to the return leg against VfB Oldenburg in the promotion play-offs for the 3. Liga on 4 June 2022. Up to 2,500 supporters of BFC Dynamo wanted to join the team in Oldenburg.[900] Around 1,300 supporters of BFC Dynamo was eventually admitted to the Marschweg-Stadion, where they marked their presence with a banner, a scarf choreography and flares.[901][902][903]\\n\\nOne of the most well-known books in Germany about the supporter scene of BFC Dynamo is \\\"Der BFC war schuld am Mauerbau\\\" by German author Andreas Gläser (de). The book was first published in 2002 and describes the supporter scene from the late 1970s and forward. The club, its reputation and supporter scene, was also the theme of stage play \\\"Dynamoland\\\" by Gudrun Herrbold. The play was set up in 2007 and involved young football players from BFC Dynamo as well as Andreas Gläser.[784][520][904] The fanzine \\\"Zugriff\\\" is dedicated to BFC Dynamo. The fanzine has been produced by Andreas Gläser and members of supporter group Gegengerade since 2008.[905] The tenth and latest issue was published in 2014. The tenth issue came with as music CD mixed by Andreas Gläser. The CD included numerous ska and punk tracks as well as a 25 seconds long recording of Erich Mielke ranting about skinheads and punks.[749]\\n\\nMusicians from German rock band Klaus Renft Combo composed the anthem \\\"Auf, Dynamo!\\\" for BFC Dynamo in 1999.[906] German rap musician Joe Rilla has also dedicated a song to BFC Dynamo. The song is called \\\"Heb die Faust Hoch (BFC Dynamo Straßenhymne)\\\" and was released in 2008. Joe Rilla, whose real name is Hagen Stoll (de), has a background in the hooligan scene of BFC Dynamo.[907] The clothing store Hoolywood on Schönhauser Allee in Prenzlauer Berg is associated with the supporter scene of BFC Dynamo. The store was founded at the beginning of the 1990s.[752][904][908] The store has been an advertising partner of BFC Dynamo.[909]\\n\\nRivalries\\nSG Dynamo Dresden\\nThe oldest rival of BFC Dynamo is SG Dynamo Dresden. The rivalry dates back to 1954 when the team of Dynamo Dresden and its place in the DDR-Oberliga was transferred to SC Dynamo Berlin during the course of the 1954-55 season. The relocation aroused a sense of victimhood among the fans of Dynamo Dresden which would later be compounded by the successes of BFC Dynamo.[758] Matters were exacerbated when additional players of Dynamo Dresden were delegated to Dynamo Berlin by the German Football Association of the GDR (DFV) following the relegation of Dynamo Dresden after the 1962–63 season.[910] The antagonism between the two clubs was underpinned by a historical German rivalry between Prussian Berlin and Saxony.[719][911] It was fueled by contemporary resentment in Dresden at the better provision of housing and consumer goods in the East German capital.[719] East Berliners were generally unpopular outside the city limits, especially in the southern regional districts of East Germany. They were considered arrogant and clearly preferred.[751]\\n\\nDynamo Dresden slowly recovered from the relocation. The club was declared a regional district center of excellence (German: Leistungszentrum) by the regional district board of the DTSB on 5 August 1968.[912][913] The club could now draw on the best players in Bezirk Dresden.[912] Dynamo Dresden eventually re-established itself in the DDR-Oberliga and became campions once again in the 1970-71 DDR-Oberliga. BFC Dynamo and Dynamo Dresden then met in the final of the 1970-71 FDGB-Pokal. Klaus Sammer scored 1-0 for Dynamo Dresden, but Norbert Johannsen equalized on a penalty. Dynamo Dresden eventually won the match 2-1 after a second goal by Sammer in extra time.[57] Dynamo Dresden thus secured the first Double in the history of East German football.[914] However, BFC Dynamo did not go completely empty-handed from the final. The team qualified for its first UEFA competition as runners-up. Its participation in the 1971–72 European Cup Winners\' Cup would be a success.\\n\\n\\nA duel between Harald Schütze (left) and Reinhard Häfner of Dynamo Dresden (right) during a match between BFC Dynamo and Dynamo Dresden in the DDR-Oberliga in 1976.\\nBFC Dynamo met Dynamo Dresden away on the sixth matchday of the 1974-75 DDR-Oberliga on 21 September 1974. The standing was 2–2 at the end of the match, after an equalizer from Norbert Johannsen on a penalty. Shortly before the final whistle, referee Robert Pischke from Rostock awarded Dynamo Dresden a controversial penalty. Siegmar Wätzlich converted the penalty and Dynamo Dresden won the match 3–2.[915][916] The East German football weekly Die neue Fußballwoche (FuWo) commented: \\\"Shortly before the end, the same thing on the other side, but this one surprised even the objective Dresdeners about it. They hadn\'t seen any opposing influence on the falling Richter... The Berliners exploded in outrage at the penalty kick, which snatched a point from them in the last minute.\\\"[916] Dynamo Dresden finished the season in third place, two points ahead of BFC Dynamo. BFC Dynamo finished the season in fourth place, but with a better goal difference. Dynamo Dresden had thus captured the place in the 1975-76 UEFA Cup narrowly ahead of BFC Dynamo. Referee Pischke was not selected for any more DDR-Oberliga matches and eventually chose to end his refereeing career.[917] He would years later become the president of F.C. Hansa Rostock.[918]\\n\\nDynamo Dresden would come to dominate East German football in the 1970s. The team managed to capture a third consecutive league title in the 1977–78 DDR-Oberliga. What happened after is subject to various rumors. Formal title celebrations took place in June 1978 at the hotel and restaurant Bastein at Prager Straße in Dresden. Erich Mielke paid a visit as the president of SV Dynamo to congratulate the team to the title. Dynamo Dresden player Reinhard Häfner recalls how Mielke held a speech where he said that he would be happier if BFC Dynamo was champions. Mielke should have added that \\\"since BFC Dynamo is also SV Dynamo, the title stays in the family, so to speak, and that is good too\\\". According to other versions of the same event, he allegedly proclaimed that everything will be done so that in the coming year, the champion will come from Berlin, and that it was now the turn of the BFC Dynamo.[919][920][921][922][nb 15]\\n\\n\\nThomas Doll and defending Matthias Döschner of Dynamo Dresden during a match between Dynamo Dresden and BFC Dynamo in 1987.\\nBFC Dynamo stood out among other clubs within SV Dynamo. The club was located at the frontline of the Cold War. It was also a representative of the capital of East Germany. This meant that the club had to be well equipped.[67] BFC Dynamo would come to benefit from a nationwide scouting system, supported by 33 training centers (TZ) of SV Dynamo across East Germany.[68][927] No less than 40 full-time trainers worked for the club.[928] The team embarked on a period of unparalleled success in the 1978–79 season under young coach Jürgen Bogs. Dynamo Dresden had been the dominant team in East German football until then. BFC Dynamo would now be its main obstacle to success.[nb 16]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo opened the 1978-79 DDR-Oberliga with ten consecutive wins. The team thus broke the previous record of Dynamo Dresden of seven consecutive wins from the 1972-73 DDR-Oberliga. Dynamo Dresden, on the other hand, had a moderately successful start to the season and stood in second place. The two teams met in the 11th matchday in front of 33,000 spectators at Dynamo-Stadion in Dresden on 2 December 1978.[934] The match ended in a draw 1-1 after an equalizer by Hans-Jürgen Riediger for BFC Dynamo. The match was marked by crowd trouble, with 38 fans to both teams arrested.[4] 17 of the 38 fans arrested were fans of BFC Dynamo.[935] Inexperienced linesman Günter Supp should allegedly have missed an offside position on Riediger in the situation leading up to the equalizer.[936][937] There were accusations in Dresden that the match had been manipulated by the referees in favor of BFC Dynamo.[4][180][201] This alleged manipulation was cited as yet another example of discrimination against the Saxon city in comparison with East Berlin.[4][180] BFC Dynamo continued to lead the league for the rest of the season. The team finally secured its first DDR-Oberliga title after defeating Dynamo Dresden 3–1 in the 24th match day in front of 22,000 spectators at Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark on 6 June 1979.[938]\\n\\nThe 1979-80 DDR-Oberliga would be tight race between the two rivals. Dynamo Dresden led the league for most of the season. Dynamo Dresden was still in first place before the last matchday. However, BFC Dynamo was only one point behind. The two rivals met at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark in the last matchday of the league season on 10 May 1980. Dynamo Dresden only needed a draw to win the league title. There was huge excitement around the match and the stadium was sold out. Die neue Fußballwoche (FuWo) reported on \\\"international match atmosphere\\\".[939] The standing was 0-0 for a long time. Dynamo Dresden player Peter Kotte fell in the BFC Dynamo penalty area with about 15 minutes left of regular time, but Dynamo Dresden was denied a penalty.[940] Norbert Trieloff instead scored a goal for BFC Dynamo just a moment later. BFC Dynamo eventually won the match 1-0 and captured its second consecutive league title in front of 30,000 spectators. Dynamo Dresden would not come this close to BFC Dynamo in the league until the end of the 1980s. It was rumoured that referee Hans Kulicke from Oderberg had favored BFC Dynamo. However, also BFC Dynamo had been denied a chance to decide the match. A goal by Hartmut Pelka had been disallowed by referee Kulicke due to a foul on Dynamo Dresden goalkeeper Bernd Jakubowski.[921]\\n\\nBoth clubs were affiliated to SV Dynamo and supported by the security organs. However, BFC Dynamo was more associated with the Stasi, while Dynamo Dresden was more associated with the Volkspolizei.[941] BFC Dynamo was known as the favourite club of the head of the Stasi Erich Mielke.[942] Dynamo Dresden, on the other hand, was patronaged by Volkspolizei Lieutenant general Willi Nyffenegger. Nyffenegger was the long-time head of the regional district authority of the Volkspolizei in Bezirk Dresden.[943] However, also Dynamo Dresden had supporters in the Stasi. The Stasi had helped Dynamo Dresden to obtain secret information about the line-up of FC Bayern Munich before the match between Dynamo Dresden and FC Bayern Munich in the 1973–74 European Cup on 7 November 1973.[944] Dynamo Dresden would also be supported by Stasi Major general Horst Böhm in the 1980s.[945] Böhm was the head of the regional district administration of the Stasi in Bezirk Dresden.[946][947][758] He was a committed local patriot when it came to Dynamo Dresden and a sponsoring member of the club.[948][947][949] The antagonism between the two clubs also spread to the Stasi Guards Regiment \\\"Felix E. Dzerzhinsky\\\".[719][4] The behavior of members of a Dresden unit during a match between the two teams in 1985 was likened to that of \\\"rioting fans\\\" by another Stasi officer.[719] Some Stasi guards had hurled abuse at BFC Dynamo players, shouting \\\"Bent champions!\\\" as they left the pitch.[758]\\n\\nResentment in Dresden over the rise of BFC Dynamo was worsened when three top players of Dynamo Dresden, Gerd Weber, Peter Kotte and Matthias Müller, were arrested on suspicion of planning to defect to West Germany in 1981.[950][4] Weber had solicited plans to defect, but the other two had not.[951] Weber received a prison sentence and a lifetime ban from playing football at any level in East Germany, while Kotte and Müller received lifetime bans from playing in the top two tiers for alleged complicity.[950][4][952] Neither would return to the Oberliga. The punishment against the three players led to rumors and protests in Dresden.[950] They also fueled local patriotism and anti-Berlin sentiments in Dresden.[950]\\n\\nFans of Dynamo Dresden saw the lifetime bans on Weber, Kotte and Müller as \\\"an order from Erich Mielke\\\" designed to weaken Dynamo Dresden.[950] Also, Kotte and Klaus Sammer has claimed they were part of a delibate plan by Mielke to weaken Dynamo Dresden.[953][954] However, such claims are doubtful.[953] The three players had been reported by an unofficial collaborator (IM) and Mielke was convinced that all three were originally prepared to defect.[951][953] Kotte was not an isolated case. The great fear of footballers, fans and officials who had fled East Germany was omnipresent at the Stasi.[955] Kotte and Müller knew about the intentions of Weber.[950] Their failure to inform authorities was critical.[950] Former SED First Secretary in Bezik Dresden Hans Modrow concludes that the measures against the three were \\\"generally cautious\\\", given the completely different consequences for other East German citizens in similar contexts. After all, the three were also members of the armed organs (German: Bewaffnete Organe der DDR) with ranks.[956] Müller said in an interview with Dresdner Neueste Nachrichten in 2011 that he \\\"knew one hundred percent\\\" that the uncompromising actions against the three players were a deliberate attempt by the Stasi to weaken Dynamo Dresden in order to secure the supremacy of BFC Dynamo.[957]\\n\\n\\nBFC Dynamo midfielder Bernd Schulz celebrates a goal against Dynamo Dresden in the DFV-Supercup together with Thomas Doll (left) and Jörg Fügner (right) in 1989.\\nBFC Dynamo and Dynamo Dresden would be the two main contenders for titles in East German football during the 1980s. BFC Dynamo dominated the DDR-Oberliga and won consecutive titles, while Dynamo Dresden had major success in the FDGB-Pokal. The two teams met in the 1981-82 FDGB-Pokal and 1983-84 FDGB-Pokal final. Dynamo Dresden won both finals and thus stopped BFC Dynamo from completing the Double.[940] The teams then also met in the 1984-85 FDGB-Pokal final. The performance of the referees in the final was controversial. A review by the DFV found that 30 percent of the referee decisions during the match had been wrong, and that 80 percent of those had been of disadvantage to Dynamo Dresden.[958] Referee Manfred Roßner was banned one year from officiating matches above second tier after the final.[959][960][958] However, nothing emerged that indicated that Roßner had been bought by the Stasi.[961] Dynamo Dresden won the final 3–2 in front of 48,000 spectators at the Stadion der Weltjugend. It was the fourth loss for BFC Dynamo against Dynamo Dresden in the final of the FDGB-Pokal and the third time that Dynamo Dresden had stopped the team from completing the Double.[940] However, BFC Dynamo would eventually succeed in completing the Double in the 1987–88 season, defeating FC Carl Zeiss Jena 2–0 in final of the 1987–88 FDGB-Pokal.\\n\\nDisturbances by spectators was a regular occurrence at matches between the two teams.[758] BFC Dynamo was met by immense hostility during away matches in Dresden. Fans of BFC Dynamo would respond to the hatred they met by singing chants in praise of Erich Mielke as a provocation.[758][178] They also made fun of the food shortage in Dresden.[753] Fans of BFC Dynamo are known to have brought coveted tropical fruits, that were only available in East Berlin, to away matches in Saxony. The fruits were then thrown at the home crowd.[178][753][751][nb 17] In Dresden they threw green bananas at the home fans and shouted: \\\"We brought you something - Bananas, bananas!\\\".[753] East German state television would always try to hide riots from viewers and sound engineers also had to drown out chants that were considered negative, such as \\\"Stasi out\\\". The match between BFC Dynamo and SG Dynamo Dresden was the most explosive encounter. At one point, the match between BFC Dynamo and SG Dynamo Dresden was even ordered to be recorded completely without sound.[776] A group of about 250 hooligans of Dynamo Dresden chanted anti-Semitic slogans against BFC Dynamo, such as \\\"Berlin Jews!\\\" and \\\"Jews\' sow!, during the match between the two teams in the 1987-88 DDR-Oberliga in East Berlin on 6 April 1988.[792][963] A number of supporters of SG Dynamo Dresden were then allegedly arrested after the match.[963]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo\'s ten-year dominance in the league was eventually broken by Dynamo Dresden in the 1988–89 season. BFC Dynamo won a second consecutive cup title in the 1988-89 FDGB-Pokal, but Dynamo Dresden became the new champion in the 1988-89 DDR-Oberliga. BFC Dynamo and Dynamo Dresden then met in the first ever DFV-Supercup in 1989. BFC Dynamo won the match 4–1 in front of 22,347 spectators at the Stadion der Freundschaft in Cottbus and became the first and only winner of the DFV-Supercup in the history of East German football.\\n\\nBFC Dynamo and Dynamo Dresden met 60 times in the Oberliga, FDGB-Pokal and DFV-Supercup between 1966 and 1991. BFC Dynamo won 21 matches and Dynamo Dresden won 27 matches. BFC Dynamo and Dynamo Dresden also met 10 times in the Regionalliga Nordost between 1995 and 2000. BFC Dynamo won 3 matches and Dynamo Dresden won 5 matches. The last meeting ended 1–1 and took place in the 1999-00 Regionalliga Nordost on 26 April 2000. The two teams rarely meet these days, because Dynamo Dresden regularly appears in the second or third tier of the German football league system. Former Dynamo Dresden player Ralf Minge expressed in an interview in 2018 his satisfaction that Dynamo Dresden has advanced past BFC Dynamo, but also said that he would not mind new duels with BFC Dynamo and that duels with BFC Dynamo \\\"have a certain charm\\\".[964]\\n\\n1. FC Union Berlin\\nFurther information: Berlin derby\\nBFC Dynamo and 1. FC Union Berlin were founded only a few days apart. Both clubs were formed during the reorganization of East German football in December 1965 and January 1966, when the football departments of ten sports clubs (SC) were reorganized into dedicated football clubs.[965] However, Union Berlin was not part of the original plan. Two football clubs had already been planned for East Berlin. They were to be formed from the football departments of SC Dynamo Berlin and ASK Vorwärts Berlin.[64] In addition, TSC Berlin played only in the second tier DDR-Liga at the time.[965][64] The founding of Union Berlin probably owed much to the intervention of the powerful Herbert Warnke.[965][762][966] Herbert Warnke was the chairman of the national state trade union FDGB and a member of the SED Politburo.[965] Dynamo Berlin and Vorwärts Berlin were both associated with the armed and security organs.[965][64] Herbert Warnke therefore argued for the formation of a civilian club for the working people of East Berlin.[965][64] He would be a passionate fan of Union Berlin.[967] Another high-ranking SED politician who pushed for the founding a civilian football club in East Berlin was the SED First Secretary in East Berlin and SED Politburo member Paul Verner.[968] Verner held a speech at the founding ceremony of Union Berlin.[969]\\n\\nBoth BFC Dynamo and Union Berlin belonged to the elite in East German football.[762][970] The new football clubs were intended as centers of excellence, with the right to draw on talents within designated geographical areas.[4][64] BFC Dynamo was supported by the Stasi, while Union Berlin was supported by the FDGB.[971][972][nb 18] However, Union Berlin was able to trace its origins back to FC Olympia Oberschöneweide in 1906.[753] BFC Dynamo had no history before East Germany. The supporters of Union Berlin therefore considered their club to be a genuine football club, unlike BFC Dynamo.[762] However, even as a civilian club, Union Berlin was also part of the sports political system.[177][975][65] The founding of the Union Berlin was organized by the then SED First Secretary in Köpenick Hans Modrow.[976] Like Herbert Warnke, Hans Modrow would be a sponsoring member of the club.[971][976] The most important positions on the board of Union Berlin were exclusively held by directors of state-owned factories or SED representatives.[65] Union Berlin was state-funded and all decisions in club had to be reported to the all-powerful central sports agency DTSB.[975] The DTSB stood in turn under direct control of the SED Central Committee.[977]\\n\\nThe rivalry between BFC Dynamo and Union Berlin began in the mid-1960s. It was initially based on the geographical proximity to each other.[66] BFC Dynamo and Union Berlin were two clubs from East Berlin in the DDR-Oberliga.[66] BFC Dynamo struggled in the 1966-67 DDR-Oberliga and was threatened with relegation. The feud between the two clubs began when fans of Union Berlin mocked BFC Dynamo with a banner saying \\\"We greet the relegated\\\" during a league match at the Stadion an der Alten Försterei on 26 April 1967.[45][972] Union Berlin won the match by 3–0 and BFC Dynamo was eventually relegated to the DDR-Liga at the end of the season.[45] While BFC Dynamo was playing in the second tier DDR-Liga, Union Berlin surprisingly won the 1967–68 FDGB-Pokal.[762] However, BFC Dynamo immediately bounced back and managed to establish itself in the DDR-Oberliga. Union Berlin would then itself be relegated to the DDR-Liga after the 1968-69 DDR-Oberliga, but also managed to return to the DDR-Oberliga after just one season in the second tier. Union Berlin would be the stronger of the two teams until the 1970s.[978]\\n\\nThe rivalry between the two clubs intensified in the early 1970s.[66] The player of Union Berlin, Klaus Korn, was suspended after a heated derby in the 1970–71 DDR-Oberliga at the Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum on 28 October 1970.[66][45] The performance of the referees had been \\\"catastrophic\\\" according to private notes from the then Second Club Secretary and Vice President of Union Berlin Günter Mielis, and the match ended with riots.[66][979][980] Klaus Korn had insulted players in BFC Dynamo with slurs such as \\\"Stasi-pig\\\". The DFV Legal Commission imposed a one-year ban on Klaus Korn after a circumstantial trial.[981][982] The DFV Legal Commission also demanded that Union Berlin considered his exclusion from the club. Klaus Korn was then excluded from the club and would never play in the DDR-Oberliga again.[981][982][66][45] Unrest broke out again at a derby in Hohenschönhausen one year later. Eight spectators were arrested after the match between BFC Dynamo and Union Berlin in the 1971–72 DDR-Oberliga at the Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum on 28 December 1971.[983] The match was attended by 14,000 spectators and the stadium was sold out.[984][712]\\n\\nThe football landscape in East Berlin changed before the 1971–72 season. Vorwärts Berlin was relocated to Frankfurt an der Oder on 31 July 1971. BFC Dynamo and Union Berlin were from now on the only major football clubs in East Berlin.[985] The relocation meant that BFC Dynamo could now take over the role of the dominant team for the armed organs in East Berlin. The team would also have opportunity to eventually move into the larger and more centrally located Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark, which led to increased interest in the club and growing attendance numbers.[66] The districts in East Berlin had previously been divided between BFC Dynamo, Vorwärts Berlin and Union Berlin. Each club was able to recruit young players from training centers (TZ) in their districts.[64][65] All training centers that had previously belonged to Vorwärts Berlin were now given to BFC Dynamo.[64][65] The DTSB allegedly saw more potential in BFC Dynamo.[64] BFC Dynamo now had access to two thirds of all training centers (TZ) in East Berlin.[65][35] This meant that BFC Dynamo had gained a much stronger position in East Berlin than Union Berlin when it came to recruiting young players.[978] FC Vorwärts Frankfurt was given Bezirk Potsdam as a catchment area, in addition to Bezirk Frankfurt. Bezirk Potsdam had previously been assigned to Union Berlin and thus had to be handed over to Vorwärts Frankfurt. This further weakened Union Berlin in relation to BFC Dynamo.[986][65][nb 19]\\n\\nUnion Berlin was relegated to the DDR-Liga after the 1972–73 season. The Union Berlin star and national team player Reinhard Lauck was transferred to BFC Dynamo after the relegation.[987] The loss of Lauck was a hard blow for the team. Lauck had contributed greatly to the victory in the final of the 1967–68 FDGB-Pokal and was well-liked among the supporters of Union Berlin.[987] Supporters of Union Berlin are said to have gathered outside his apartment, to appeal to him to stay in the team and play in the second tier.[988][989] But Lauck had already decided to change team.[988][990] The DFV had allegedly advised him to switch to BFC Dynamo in order to continue playing in the national team.[987] According to a regulation in the 1970 DFV Football Resolution (German: DFV-Fußballbeschluss), national team players in clubs that had been relegated from the DDR-Oberliga should switch clubs in order to remain competitive.[991] Lauck would make a successful appearance for East Germany in the 1974 FIFA World Cup and would win gold with East Germany in the 1976 Summer Olympics.[987][989] Lauck became the team captain of BFC Dynamo in the 1974–75 season.[82] He would later win two league titles with BFC Dynamo before ending his career due to a knee injury.[989][992]\\n\\nUnion Berlin would remain in the DDR-Liga for several seasons. Instead of playing matches against BFC Dynamo in the DDR-Oberliga, the team was now left to compete with the reserve team of BFC Dynamo, the BFC Dynamo II. Union Berlin would also suffer more blows which further weakened its position in relation to BFC Dynamo. Herbert Warnke passed in 1975 and was replaced as chairman of the FDGB by Harry Tisch.[971] Harry Tisch had begun his political career in Rostock and chose instead to give the support of the FDGB to F.C. Hansa Rostock.[971] Union Berlin thus lost the support of the FDGB and also no longer had any support in the top of the political hierarchy.[993] From no on, the club could only rely on support from the district administration of the SED in East Berlin and local state-owned enterprises, such as VEB Kabelwerk Oberspree (KWO) and VEB Transformatorenwerk Oberschöneweide (TRO).[994][971]\\n\\nThe DTSB and the DFV had also continued their efforts to concentrate resources on a few clubs during the 1970s.[995] A number of football clubs became specially promoted focus clubs in the 1970 DFV Football Resolution.[60][996] The focus clubs were meant to be strengthened through player transfers. Players in teams that had been relegated from the DDR-Oberliga should also switch to focus clubs.[997] The focus clubs were also equipped with more staff as well as better material and technical conditions.[998][60][996] BFC Dynamo became the focus club in East Berlin.[999][1000][995][nb 20] Even more advantages were then given to the focus clubs in the 1976 DFV Football Resolution. The focus clubs would now be allowed to delegate youth players from other football clubs. They would also be provided with more youth coaches from the DFV and have the right to accommodate twice as many students in their affiliated Children and Youth Sports Schools (KJS) every year, compared to other football clubs.[1001][999][1002] Union Berlin would now have to delegate some of its best young players to BFC Dynamo.[978][nb 21] One example was the talented Detlef Helms, who was delegated to BFC Dynamo as a 17-year-old in 1977.[65][970]\\n\\nUnion Berlin returned to the Oberliga in the 1976–77 season. Stadion an der Alten Försterei was a small football stadium without cinder tracks where the crowd stood close to the pitch.[762][990] Union Berlin had become the focus of hooligan attention.[719] Matches at the Stadion an der Alten Föresterei had regularly been interrupted by spectators throwing objects on the pitch.[1003] The derby between BFC Dynamo and Union Berlin was now such as heated affair that the matches were moved by the DFV to the neutral Stadion der Weltjugend in Mitte.[1004] It was considered that safety could not be guaranteed with the larger number of spectators.[1005][1006][719][762] The Stadion an der Alten Försterei was known for its atmosphere and the Stadion der Weltjugend was located only a few minutes away from the home district of BFC Dynamo.[990][66] The move was therefore seen as a major disadvantage by the fans to Union Berlin and further diluted their aversion to BFC Dynamo.[45][66][nb 22] Union Berlin defeated BFC Dynamo 1–0 in front of 45,000 spectators at the Stadion der Weltjugend in the first meeting of the 1976–77 season on 4 September 1976.[1008][294][95] Union Berlin also won the return match on 19 February 1977.[95] The two wins against BFC Dynamo during the 1976–77 season cemented the reputation of Union Berlin as a cult club and crowd puller.[1009]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo established itself as one of the top teams in the DDR-Oberliga from the mid-1970s. Union Berlin would come to play second fiddle in East Berlin from now on and never finish higher than seventh place in the DDR-Oberliga.[1010] In the shadow of BFC Dynamo, Union Berlin would no longer have any major sporting significance in East Germany.[1011] Union Berlin became a yo-yo team that hovered between the Oberliga and the DDR-Liga.[1010] Supporters of Union Berlin saw BFC Dynamo as the highest representative of the security organs and the police, with privileges in player recruitment and financial support as well as the political clout of Mielke.[762] This was supposedly in contrast to their own club, which they regarded as an underdog rooted in the working class.[762][719][1012][753] BFC Dynamo would be disliked all over East Germany for its successes and its connection to the Stasi.[910][137][38] This was also reflected in the derby between BFC Dynamo and Union Berlin.[137] The supporters of Union Berlin were seen as oppositional.[137] This is illustrated in the famous sentence of the editor-in-chief of the satirical magazine Eulenspiegel: \\\"Not all Union fans are enemies of the state, but all enemies of the state are Union fans.\\\"[137][1013] But the fact that people supported Union Berlin did not automatically mean that they were against the state.[177] Union Berlin got a lot of sympathy as the weaker club.[177][1014] There was a simple rule in East German football, where the least privileged club got the most sympathy.[178] Supporters of Union Berlin cultivated the image of their club as the eternal underdog.[762][1015]\\n\\nClashes between the supporters of the two teams became increasingly common in the 1970s. Union Berlin had one of the most notorious followings in East Germany at this time.[32] The supporters of Union Berlin often went to away matches in large numbers.[32] Fights were initially won by the supporters of Union Berlin. They were in the clear majority and could chase the supporters of BFC Dynamo from the streets.[972] A punch in the face and a stolen scarf was an experience for many young supporters of BFC Dynamo at this time.[990] But BFC Dynamo gained more and more young supporters with its growing successes in the late 1970s.[174] Many came from working-class families in Prenzlauer Berg.[749] The supporters of BFC Dynamo would eventually begin to appear extremely well organized and by the early 1980s they began to fight back.[972][32] The tide now turned and the supporters of BFC Dynamo would win all fights between the supporters of the two teams from now on.[972][990] Derbies at the Stadion der Weltjugend usually ended with a couple of hundred supporters of BFC Dynamo chasing the supporters of Union Berlin along Chausseestraße down towards the Friedrichsstrasse S-Bahn station.[1016][32][1017] The fights often continued on the side streets of Friedrichstraße.[1017]\\n\\nUnion Berlin is sometimes portrayed as having been an opponent of the East German system and derbies between BFC Dynamo and Union Berlin during the East German era have been hyped as some kind of domestic political showdown.[1018] But Union Berlin was mostly just a club struggling against unfavorable conditions.[1018] The club had become disadvantaged by the state sports politics compared to local rival BFC Dynamo.[1018] Honorary President of Union Berlin Günter Mielis has said: \\\"Union was not a club of resistance fighters, but we had to fight against a lot of political and economic resistance over and over again. We got strength from our fans\\\".[1019] However, Union Berlin would eventually become known for a supporter scene that was anti-establishment, where dissidents could vent their disdain for the system in the anonymity of a crowd.[1010] Supporters of Union Berlin also saw themselves as stubborn and non-conformist, but this image should not be confused with actual resistance.[38] Provocation was part of football in East Germany and people shouted out anything, because it was possible to get away with it.[1020] A critical attitude to the system was something that football supporters across East Germany had in common in the 1970s and 1980s.[1021]\\n\\nSupporters of Union Berlin from the East German era concede that it is an exaggeration to call the club a \\\"resistance club\\\".[1022][970] A supporter of Union Berlin has said: \\\"With the best of intentions, Union fans did not contribute to the overthrow of the GDR. No way, we were interested in football. There is the cliché about the club for the enemies of the state, but that wasn\'t us\\\".[1023] There were no political groups among the supporters of Union Berlin.[1024] For some supporters of Union Berlin, the dissident reputation of Union Berlin is a legend that was created after Die Wende.[1022] A controversy erupted around Union Berlin in 2011 when it became publicly known that the then President of Union Berlin Dirk Zingler had been a member of the Stasi Guards Regiment \\\"Felix E. Dzerzhinsky\\\" for three years during his military service between 1983 and 1986.[1025][1026] Zingler explained that he had sought to spend his military service in Berlin and claimed that he did not know beforehand that the regiment belonged to the Stasi.[1027] However, the Stasi Guards Regiment \\\"Felix E. Dzerzhinsky\\\" was an elite formation; it was not possible to simply apply for the regiment. The Stasi selected who it thought were best fit to serve with the regiment, only accepting recruits that were \\\"loyal to the line\\\".[1027][1028] Zingler had also been a member of the Socialist Unity Party (SED) and leader in the Free German Youth (FDJ) at the time.[1029][1028] Union Berlin Press spokesman Christian Arbeit commented on the reports about Zingler in 2011 saying: \\\"We do have a very unique history, compared to other clubs. But it wasn\'t us that always claimed we were this big anti-Stasi club. These are stories that get simplified in the media.\\\"[1026]\\n\\nMost supporters of Union Berlin were just normal football supporters.[1020] Politics was not in the foreground.[970] Supporters of Union Berlin from the era have testified that their support for the club had nothing to do with politics.[1030] The club was the most important thing and the identification with Union Berlin had primarily to do with Köpenick.[1030][1031] The rivalry was fueled by local pride from the supporters of the two teams.[1032] However, the political dimension was there nonetheless.[1010] BFC Dynamo was supported by the Stasi, who was disliked by many.[1010] But above all, it was the political instrumentalization of football that irritated supporters of Union Berlin.[1033] The political favoritism of BFC Dynamo greatly contributed to the enthusiasm of the supporters of Union Berlin.[972] Supporters of Union Berlin embraced the image of the underdog fighting the odds.[1004] An expression of the supporters of Union Berlin was: \\\"Better to be a loser than a stupid Stasi pig\\\".[1011]\\n\\nThe derby between BFC Dynamo and Union Berlin was first and foremost a local football derby.[1010] Both clubs had supporters who were not loyal to the line.[1024][1034][751] Also supporters of BFC Dynamo were observed by the Stasi during the 1980s.[1035] East Berlin was divided into two: BFC Dynamo was more strongly represented in some parts, and Union Berlin was more strongly represented in other parts.[972] Which team you supported was very much a question of where you lived.[32] BFC Dynamo was the local team if you grew up in Prenzlauer Berg.[1036] And you lived in Mitte, you were also more likely to be a supporter BFC Dynamo, as the home stadium was only a stone\'s throw away along Schönhauser Allee.[32] But Mitte was also a contested area.[759] The border allegedly ran at Alexanderplatz, where many fights between the supporters of the two teams were fought.[972][760] The home districts of the two clubs, Hohenschönhausen and Köpenick respectively, were always dangerous territory for supporters of the other team.[972]\\n\\n\\nBFC Dynamo midfielder Bernd Schulz (right) celebrating together with team captain Frank Rohde (left) after scoring a goal against 1. FC Union Berlin at the Stadion der Weltjugend on 18 March 1989.\\nBFC Dynamo and Union Berlin met a total of 35 times in the DDR-Oberliga and the FDGB-Pokal. BFC Dynamo won 22 meetings and Union Berlin won 6 meetings. Matches against Union Berlin was often won with big numbers in the late 1970s and 1980s.[45][203] BFC Dynamo defeated Union Berlin with 1–8 and then 7–1 in the round of 16 of the 1978-79 FDGB-Pokal.[45] Hans-Jürgen Riediger scored a hat-trick in both legs.[1037][1038] BFC Dynamo also defeated Union Berlin 8–1 in the Oberliga on 13 September 1986. Thom, Frank Pastor and Christian Backs scored two goals each.[1039] The 1980s was a crushing win for BFC Dynamo. Former BFC Dynamo midfielder Falko Götz concluded that: \\\"Union was no opponent to us\\\".[1016] The two teams met 13 times in the Oberliga and FDGB-Pokal during the 1980s. BFC Dynamo won 11 matches and two matches ended in a draw. The matches between the two local rivals were hard-fought on the pitch.[294] Former BFC Dynamo midfielder Frank Terletzki has said that the victories against Union Berlin were always the best.[203] But despite the rivalry between the clubs, it happened that players hung out outside of football.[1040] Former BFC Dynamo defender Frank Rohde has said that players of BFC Dynamo and Union Berlin often gathered to have a beer together after matches.[294]\\n\\nThere were several transfers between the two clubs. BFC Dynamo recruited some of the best players of Union Berlin, such as Reinard Lauck in 1973, Detlef Helms in 1977 and Waldemar Ksienzyk in 1984.[45][970] But there were also transfers in the other direction. Union Berlin predecessor TSC Oberschöneweide recruited Ralf Quest from SC Dynamo Berlin in 1962. Quest scored the winning goal for Union Berlin in the final of the 1967-68 FDGB-Pokal, when the club won a sensational cup victory.[1041] Union Berlin would then recruit several players from BFC Dynamo over the years, such as Werner Heine in 1966, Werner Voigt, Bernd Kempke and Michael Jakob in 1973, Rainer Rohde in 1976, Rainer Wroblewski in 1977, Olaf Seier in 1983, Ralf Sträßer in 1984, Olaf Hirsch in 1986, Norbert Trieloff in 1987, Mario Maek in 1988, and Marco Kostmann and Thomas Grether in 1989, and Bernd Schulz in 1990.[95][970][294][1042] Union Berlin recruited a couple of players from BFC Dynamo in the 1980s who did some of their best seasons at the club.[1043][990] Olaf Seier became the team captain of Union Berlin and Ralf Sträßer became first and only player in Union Berlin to ever become league top goal scorer during the East German era.[65] Mario Maek saved Union Berlin from relegation with a late 3–2 goal against FC Karl-Marx-Stadt in the last match day of the 1987-88 DDR-Oberliga.[970][1044] As many as three former players of BFC Dynamo were involved in the winning goal for Union Berlin.[1044]\\n\\n\\nSupporters of FC Berlin during a match against 1. FC Union Berlin at the Stadion an der Alten Försterei on 23 September 1990.\\nUnion Berlin played in the DDR-Liga in the 1989–90 season. FC Berlin and Union Berlin met in the second round of the 1990-91 FDGB-Pokal at the Stadion an der Alten Försterei on 23 September 1990. It was the first match between the teams since the fall of the Berlin Wall. BFC Dynamo, now named FC Berlin, had now already lost many of its former top-performers to the West German Bundesliga.[1045][809] Union Berlin was now coached by the former BFC Dynamo player and youth coach Werner Voigt.[1046] Hooligans of FC Berlin stormed the home stands armed with clubs and flares and attacked supporters of Union Berlin at the beginning of the match.[263][809] Union Berlin won the match 2–1 on extra-time.[809] It was the first win for Union Berlin against FC Berlin since 1977.[263] Thomas Grether scored the first goal and Olaf Seier scored the winning goal for Union Berlin in the match. Both players had been brought up in the youth department of BFC Dynamo and had played matches for BFC Dynamo in the DDR-Oberliga.[809] Clashes between supporters of the two teams continued in the city after the match. Serious riots broke out in East Berlin, involving hundreds of supporters.[811]\\n\\nFC Berlin and Union Berlin then met in the promotion round to the 2. Bundesliga in the 1990–91 season. FC Berlin lost the first match 1–0 away in the second round at the Stadion an der Alten Försterei on 8 June 1991. Former BFC Dynamo player Bernd Schulz scored the winning goal for Union Berlin.[1047] FC Berlin then defeated Union Berlin 2–0 in the return match in fifth round in front of 9,475 spectators at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark on 18 June 1991. Heiko Bonan and Thorsten Boer scored one goal each in the match.[1048] FC Berlin was only one point behind leader BSG Stahl Brandenburg before the last round. The team managed to defeat Magdeburg 3–5 away on 23 June 1991. However, BSG Stahl Brandenburg defeated Union Berlin 2–0 away. FC Berlin thus finished in second place and missed promotion. Some supporters of BFC Dynamo are convinced that Union Berlin deliberately lost in order to prevent FC Berlin from advancing to the 2. Bundesliga.[257] FC Berlin and Union Berlin then also met in the promotion round for the 2. Bundesliga in 1991–92 season. FC Berlin won the first match 3–0 at home in the third round on 31 May 1992. The team then also won the return match 0–4 away in the fourth round on 7 June 1992.\\n\\nThe two teams met again in the new Regionalliga Nordost that was formed in 1994–95 season. Werner Voigt became the new coach of FC Berlin during the 1995–96 season. Voigt had a long history with BFC Dynamo but also had history with Union Berlin. Voigt had played for Union Berlin between 1973 and 1975 and had coached the team between 1990 and 1992.[1046] FC Berlin under coach Voigt lost 0–6 to 1. FC Union Berlin in the 1996–97 Regionalliga Nordost at the Stadion im Sportforum on 28 September 1996. It was the biggest defeat so far to Union Berlin.[294] Former FC Berlin player Thorsten Boer scored two goals for Union Berlin in the match.[1049] The two teams met 12 times in total in Regionalliga Nordost between 1994 and 2000. BFC Dynamo won one match and Union Berlin won eight matches. The two teams then met in the round of 16 of the 2000-01 Berlin Cup. The match was played in front of 4,427 spectators at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark on 24 March 2001.[351] Union Berlin won the match 0–3. Riots broke out among supporters of BFC Dynamo in Prenzlauer Berg after the match. The police had to deploy water cannons to control the situation.[855] The most recent meetings between BFC Dynamo and Union Berlin occurred in the 2005–06 NOFV-Oberliga Nord. The first match was played at the Stadion an der Alten Försterei on 21 August 2005. BFC Dynamo was missing striker Danny Kukulies and first-choice goalkeeper Nico Thomaschewski before the match. Kukulies was suspended and Thomaschewski injured.[1050][1051] German police and members of the SEK carried out a controversial raid against supporters of BFC Dynamo the night before the match.[440] Club management initially considered withdrawing from the match. The players voted on whether or not to play the match against Union Berlin.[865] More than 1,000 police officers were deployed to the match.[1016] BFC Dynamo eventually lost 8–0.[970] The return match was played at the Stadion im Sportforum on 13 May 2006. The score was 1–1 when around 200 supporters of BFC Dynamo stormed the pitch to attack supporters of Union Berlin.[456][871][873] Supporters of Union Berlin fled the guest block in panic.[872] The match was abandoned and Union Berlin was awarded a 2–0 victory.[871][873] The two teams has not met since then.\\n\\nBFC Dynamo met the reserve team of Union Berlin six times in the NOFV-Oberliga Nord and Regionalliga Nordost between 2010 and 2015. Union Berlin II won the first five matches. The last match was played in the 2014-15 Regionalliga Nordost on 15 March 2015. BFC Dynamo defeated Union Berlin II 1–0 in front of 8,169 spectators at Stadion an der Alten Försterei. The match was interrupted for 18 minutes when supporters of Union Berlin tried to attack the supporters of BFC Dynamo.[552][1052][45] 112 police officers were injured and 175 supporters were arrested during the match.[1053][45] Some media reported that 300 supporters of Union Berlin had participated in the attack on guest supporters. Journalist Frank Willmann attended the match and claims that the number was rather 30. He also said he did not see any injured police.[1052] There have been several cases of violence between the supporters of the two teams during the 2010s.[1054] Around a hundred hooligans from Union Berlin tried to attack a senior tournament organized by BFC Dynamo in the Dynamo-Sporthalle on 30 January 2010.[1055][1056][1057][875] Also women and children got in the way of the attack.[1057] Around 30 partially masked supporters from Union Berlin attacked players and a small group of supporters of BFC Dynamo in connection with a senior match between Union Berlin and BFC Dynamo at the Sportanlage Hämmerlingstraße in Köpenick on 27 March 2015.[1058][45][1054] One player of BFC Dynamo and two guest spectators were injured.[45] A number of supporters of BFC Dynamo joined Hertha BSC in the guest block of the Stadion an der Alten Försterei during the derby between Union Berlin and Hertha BSC on 2 November 2019.[899]\\n\\nOrganization\\nCurrent board and management\\nAs of 1 August 2023[1059][1060][1061][1062][1063]\\nBerliner Fussball Club Dynamo e.

The U17 team competes in the third tier B-Junior Verbandsliga Berlin and the U19 team competes in second tier A-Junior Regionalliga Nordost.[1094] The youth teams are based in the Sportforum Hohenschönhausen.[637]\\n\\nThere were more than 800 children and youth players in the club as of 2019.[1095] Many children in the club comes from immigrant backgrounds or socially disadvantaged families.[637][1096][626][753][608][634] BFC Dynamo helped football club FC Berlin 23 from neighbouring Storkower Straße in September 2021 and saved more than 40 to 50 children from the club, which was about to be dissolved.[608]\\n\\nThe club launched the so-called \\\"Kita-projekt\\\" in 2003.[637] The Kita-projekt is a day care project that gives boys and girls aged 3 to 6 the opportunity to participate in sports on a regular basis.[637][1097] The Kita-projekt involved approximately 200 children from 16 day care centers in Berlin as of 2020.[1096] The majority of the children come from the localities or former boroughs of Lichtenberg, Hohenschönhausen, Karlshorst, Mitte, Weißensee and Pankow.[1097] The Kita-projekt was the first of its kind in Germany and has received several awards for its work with children.[637][1098][1099] The former professional player of BFC Dynamo Jörn Lenz is the head of the Kita-projekt as of 2021.[1099]\\n\\nThe so-called \\\"Jugendförderverein\\\" was founded in 2004.[426] It is a registered voluntary association that aims to promote youth sports at BFC Dynamo. The Jugendförderverein has supported youth teams with equipment, covered costs for trips to tournaments and helped youth trainers to be able to obtain their trainer license. The Jugendförderverein relies on donations and voluntary work.[1100] Former Club President Mario Weinkauf was one of the seven founding members of the Jugenförderverein and briefly served as chairman of the association before he became club president. Weinkauf had also been a youth trainer in the club for some time.[426]\\n\\nYouth academy during East German era\\nBFC Dynamo had a very successful youth academy during the East German era.[1016][174][201] The youth department had full-time trainers available for all youth classes and access to the best material conditions in the Dynamo-Sportforum.[105][1101] There were no less than 40 full-time trainers in the club.[928] Youth coaches were highly qualified and training in the Children and Youth Sports School (KJS) was extensive.[1102][1103] The youth work at BFC Dynamo during the East German era was described as \\\"absolutely leading\\\" by former coach Jürgen Bogs, who had a background as coach of the junior team.[105][1101] It was also described as \\\"exquisite\\\" by former German sports journalist Horst Friedemann, who worked for Deutsches Sportecho and Kicker.[201]\\n\\nThe upper tier of elite clubs in East Germany had privileged access to talents within designated geographical and administrative areas.[4][1104] All designated football clubs were assigned one or two regional districts in East Germany as catchment areas at their founding in 1965–1966. BFC Dynamo was initially assigned Bezirk Cottbus and one third of the districts in East Berlin.[35][65] The club was later allowed to take over the training centers (German: Trainingszentrum) (TZ) in East Berlin that had previously belonged to the catchment area of FC Vorwärts Berlin, when FC Vorwärts Berlin was relocated to Frankfurt an der Oder before the 1971-72 season.[64][65]\\n\\nHowever, BFC Dynamo, as well as FC Vorwärts Berlin and SG Dynamo Dresden, also had another structural advantage when it came to recruiting talents.[1105] Most sports associations (German: Sportvereinigung) (SV) were dissolved at the founding of the DTSB in 1957.[1106] However, sports associations SV Dynamo and ASV Vorwärts were allowed to continue exist.[1107] A decision in the SED Politburo in 1962 then stipulated that the sports associations SV Dynamo and ASV Vorwärts were allowed to set up sports communities in each location where they operated offices. This meant that SV Dynamo and ASV Vorwärts would be able to run sports communities across the country.[1108] BFC Dynamo would eventually be able recruit talents from the youth departments of all sports communities (German: Sportgemeinschaft) (SG) of SV Dynamo in East Germany, except those in Bezirk Dresden and a number of other sports communities in the southern regional districts that belonged to the catchment area of SG Dynamo Dresden.[105][4][1109][nb 39]\\n\\nThe basis of the East German selection and screening system in competitive sports would eventually consist of special training centers (TZ).[1113][1114][nb 40] SV Dynamo would operate numerous training centers across the whole of East Germany. The training centers were either assigned to BFC Dynamo or SG Dynamo Dresden, depending on catchment area. Training in these training centers were better than elsewhere. The work in the training centers was supervised and directed by BFC Dynamo. The best talents from the individual training centers were then brought together and selected in a multi-day screening session.[69] BFC Dynamo would come to benefit from a nationwide scouting network, which included the partnership with Bezirk Cottbus and 33 training centers (TZ) of SV Dynamo.[1118][1119][68] In total, BFC Dynamo had access to 38 training centers (TZ) across East Germany for the recruitment of talents. As a comparison, Union Berlin had only access to six training centers (TZ), all of which were located in the Berlin area.[70]\\n\\nA number of football clubs became specially promoted focus clubs in the 1970 DFV Football Resolution.[60][999] The focus clubs would receive additional financial support from the DTSB and other advantages.[998][996] In the 1976 DFV Football Resolution, focus clubs were also allowed delegate youth players from other football clubs.[1001] BFC Dynamo became the focus club in East Berlin. As a focus club, BFC Dynamo had the right to delegate 12 students to its affiliated Children and Youth Sports Schools (KJS) every year.[1109][1002] Non-focus football clubs only had the right to delegate six students to their affiliated Children and Youth Sports School (KJS) every year.[1002] The elite Children and Youth Sports School (KJS) \\\"Werner Seelenbinder\\\" provided boarding and schooling for talented players in the Sportforum.[1120][1121][1107] The Children and Youth Sports School (KJS) \\\"Werner Seelenbinder\\\" was affiliated to sports club SC Dynamo Berlin.[1122]\\n\\nThe success of BFC Dynamo during the East German era was based on the club\'s extensive youth work.[1123][1124][105][201] In 1975, there were as many as five national team players in the East Germany junior national football team among the club\'s youth players from the class of 1957.[98]1 Only a fifth of the players who won the ten East German championships with BFC Dynamo were older than 18 years when they joined the club.[990] The youth academy produced stars such as Lutz Eigendorf, Falko Götz and Andreas Thom.[1120][1016][1102][752] Most of the top performers of BFC Dynamo in the 1980s came through the club\'s own youth teams, including Frank Terletzki, Hans-Jürgen Riediger, Norbert Trieloff, Bodo Rudwaleit, Ralf Sträßer, Artur Ullrich, Rainer Ernst, Bernd Schulz, Christian Backs, Frank Rohde, Falko Götz, Jan Voß, Andreas Thom, Jörg Fügner, Hendrik Herzog and Marco Köller.[1125][1126][1127] Several former players of SC Dynamo Berlin and BFC Dynamo became youth trainers in the club after ending their playing careers, such as Herbert Schoen, Hermann Bley, Günter Schröter, Martin Skaba, Peter Rohde, Werner Voigt, Hartmut Pelka and Hans-Jürgen Riediger.[1128][1129][1125][1130][1131]\\n\\nNumerous players from East Germany joined West German clubs at the end of East Germany. Many came from BFC Dynamo. More than 110 players who had been trained in East Germany, primarily in a Children and Youth Sports School (KJS), would go on to play for West German or West Berlin clubs in the Bundesliga after the end of East Germany. German author Michael Peter has created a database for all players who had been trained in East Germany and who played for West German or West Berlin football clubs after 1990. For players born before 1976, BFC Dynamo was the biggest contributor. 98 players, born before 1976, came from the ten designated football clubs and SG Dynamo Dresden. 18 of these, came from BFC Dynamo.[1108]\\n\\nHonours\\nNext Generation Oberliga (German: Nachwuchsoberliga) (de)[a]\\nWinners: 1981, 1991[b]\\nRunners-up (6): 1979, 1983\\nEast German Junior Championship (de)[c]\\nWinners: (5) 1960,[d] 1978, 1979, 1987, 1991\\nRunners-up (6): 1967, 1974, 1976, 1977, 1988, 1989\\nEast German Youth Championship (Youth FDJ-Pokal) (de)[e]\\nWinners: (4) 1967, 1972, 1975, 1987\\nRunners-up: 1983, 1989\\nEast German Junior Cup (Junge Welt-Pokal) (de)[c]\\nWinners: (5) 1966, 1967, 1987, 1989, 1990[b] (record)\\nEast German Youth Cup (Youth FDGB-Pokal)[e]\\nWinners: (5) 1965,[d] 1968, 1971, 1972, 1976 (record)\\n Corresponds to U21 level. The league existed from 1976 to 1983 and 1989 to 1991. The reserve teams of the 14 DDR-Oberliga clubs were no longer allowed to participate in the DDR-Liga after the 1975-76 season. The Junior Oberliga (de) was also disbanded after the season. The Next Generation Oberliga was introduced instead. Youth teams of the 14 DDR-Oberliga clubs were all were eligible to start in the 1976-77 Next Generation Oberliga. Next Generation Oberliga was disbanded after the 1982-83 season. All teams were instead assigned to the third tier Bezirksliga. BFC Dynamo participted in the 1983-84 Bezirksliga Berlin with reseve team BFC Dynamo II. BFC Dynamo II won the 1983-84 Bezirksliga Berlin and qualified for the 1984-85 DDR-Liga A.\\n Won as FC Berlin.\\n Corresponds to U19 level.\\n Won by SC Dynamo Berlin.\\n Corresponds to U17 level.\\nExplanatory notes\\n This was not the first or last relocation or transfer of entire football teams in East Germany at the time. Sports association SV Deutsche Volkpolizei relocated its three second-tier teams SV Deutsche Volkspolizei Potsdam, SV Deutsche Volkspolizei Weimar and SV Deutsche Volkspolizei Schwerin to sports communities in larger cities during the summer of 1952. SV Deutsche Volkspolizei Potsdam was relocated to Berlin, SV Deutsche Volkspolizei Weimar to Erfurt and SV Deutsche Volkspolizei Schwerin to Rostock.[6]The team of SV Vorwärts der KVP Leipzig was relocated to East Berlin in 1953. The team continued the 1953-54 DDR-Oberliga as SV Vorwärts der KVP Berlin. SV Vorwärts der KVP Berlin then became ASK Vorwärts Berlin, which later became FC Vorwärts Berlin.[7][4] The relatively successful team of BSG Empor Lauter and its place in the DDR-Oberliga was transferred to sports club SC Empor Rostock in 1954. The football department of SC Empor Rostock later became F.C. Hansa Rostock.[8] The team of BSG Turbine Halle and its place in the DDR-Oberliga was transferred to sports club SC Chemie Halle-Leuna in 1954.[9] The football department of SC Chemie Halle-Leuna later became Hallescher FC Chemie.\\n SG Dynamo Dresden itself had a background that involved political interference and player delegations. SG Dynamo Dresden was previously known as SV Deutsche Volkspolizei Dresden. When SG Friedrichstadt was dissolved by East German sports authorities after the 1949–50 DDR-Oberliga, the playing right in the DDR-Oberliga was transferred to SV Deutsche Volkspolizei Dresden.[10][8][11] SV Deutsche Volkspolizei Dresden had previously played in the lower-tier Stadtliga Dresden and was thus able to enter the DDR-Oberliga without having to progress through divisions.[12][13] In order to keep the place in the DDR-Oberliga, the team of SV Deutsche Volkspolizei Dresden would be reinforced with players from Volkspolizei teams all over the country.[14] The head of the Volkspolizei Kurt Fischer ordered that best football players in the sports communities of the Volkspolizei around East Germany should be concentrated in the now first-tier SV Deutsche Volkspolizei Dresden.[15] The 40 best players of the various Volkspolizei teams in East Germany were then brought together for a training session in Forst in July 1950. Coaches Fritz Sack and Paul Döring then picked out 17 players from 11 different cities who were delegated to Dresden to form the team.[16][11] SV Deutsche Volkspolizei Potsdam lost its five best players and was severaly weakened.[13][17]\\n However, newspaper Neues Deutschland reported an attendance number of 60,000 spectators.[20]\\n BFC Dynamo played friendly matches against Pogoń Szczecin in 1966, 1969, 1973, two times in 1975, 1977, two times in 1978, 1980, 1984, 1985, 1986 and 1987.[43]\\n SV Dynamo would eventually operate numerous training centers (TZ) across East Germany. The training centers were divided between BFC Dynamo and SG Dynamo Dresden depending on catchment area.[69]\\n German author Steffen Karas also claims in his book \\\"66 Jahre BFC Dynamo - Auswärts mit \'nem Bus\\\" that BFC Dynamo actually only scored nine match-deciding goals in the 86th minute or later, in the 218 matches it won or drew during its ten championship years. Only one of those goals came from a penalty. That penalty was the controversial penalty against 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig in the 1985-86 DDR-Oberliga on 22 March 1986, which was later proven to be correct.[205]\\n Karin Halsch was known as Karin Seidel-Kalmutzki at the time.[339]\\n Sources vary on the history of the stadium. A few sources state that the stadium was constructed in 1954 and then refurbished in 1973.[685][693] A centrally located football stadium is depicted in the early plans for the Dynamo-Sportforum by architects Walter Schmidt and Heinz Scharlipp.[694] Other sources suggest that the stadium was completed in its current form in 1970.[695][688][696]\\n The capacity was 12,000 at the beginning of the 1966–67 season and 14,000 at the beginning of the 1968–69 season.[706][707]\\n The skinhead movement in East Germany grew out of the punk subculture, and was characterized as an aggressive form of protest.[777][778] It was radicalized in the middle of the 1980s, by a hybrid of ultranationalism, xenophobia and anti-communism.[778] East Berlin was the epicenter of the East German skinhead movement, with BFC Dynamo and 1. FC Union Berlin as its two football magnets.[778][779] The Stasi concluded that about 30-40 skinheads were associated to the two clubs in December 1985. Many were attached to fan cub Anale Berlin at BFC Dynamo.[778] Anale Berlin became infamous for its violence capital and glorification of fascism.[778][779] There were around 300–400 skinheads in East Berlin in December 1987.[780][717] Many were fans of BFC Dynamo.[717] Reports noted a group of roughly 100 skinheads that regularly attended the away matches of BFC Dynamo in 1988.[781] And the Stasi estimated that there were about 30 skinheads among the followers of 1. FC Union Berlin in July 1988.[4][781] Despite the fierce rivalry between BFC Dynamo and 1. FC Union Berlin, there were contacts between skinheads of the two clubs.[32] Far-right skinheads were attached to fan clubs Borussen and Die Löwen at 1. FC Union Berlin.[772][782]\\n However, hooligans of BFC Dynamo and skinheads allegedly attached to the hooligan scene of BFC Dynamo were also involved in serious incidents associated with racism and right wing-extremism in the 1980s. Hooligans of BFC Dynamo attacked 26 Cuban guest workers on train D 1056 towards Berlin-Lichtenberg, while returning from a match in Halle on 12 May 1984.[788][789] The hooligans had allegedly shouted racist slogans and sung the Deutschlandlied. At least nine Cubans were injured.[790] A number of skinheads allegedly attached to the hooligan scene of BFC Dynamo were also among those convicted for the much-publicized attack on a punk concert in the Zionskirche church in East Berlin on 17 October 1987.[178][137] However, incidents associated to racism and right-wing extremism in East German football were not isolated to BFC Dynamo and authorities also recorded the use of racists slogans, such as \\\"Jewish pigs!\\\", by supporters of several other teams at the time, including SG Dynamo Dresden and 1. FC Union Berlin.[791][792][793]\\n Several sources claim that a group of 500 hooligans of BFC Dynamo attacked a gas station, looted shops and attacked the Volkspolizei in Jena in November 1989.[32][799][459][788][798] One source specifically claims that the incidents occurred in connection to an away match in the DDR-Oberliga.[799] However, the sources do not specify any exact date or any details regarding which match the incidents occur in connection with. FC Berlin played away against FC Carl Zeiss Jena in the 18th matchday of the 1989-90 DDR-Oberliga on 8 April 1990.\\n Hooligans in Magdeburg attacked Soviet soldiers on 29 August 1990. One officer fired a warning shot.[803] The police fired warning shots during violent riots after the friendly match between 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig and FC Bayern Munich on 6 September 1990.[803][813][815] The match between FC Sachsen Leipzig and FC Carl Zeiss Jena in the 1990-91 NOFV-Oberliga on 29 September 1990 was abandoned shortly before the end due to violent riots in the stadium.[813][814]\\n However, the high number of supporters of FC Berlin at the scene claimed by the police has been disputed.[820] The number of supporters of FC Berlin on the scene varies between different sources. The police initially stated that they had faced up to 500 hooligans.[817][824] However, an eyewitness stated that the group that arrived at the S-Bahn station and marched towards the stadium rather consisted of only 150 supporters. This group was supposedly met by around 50 police officers outside the stadium.[820] Neues Deutschland reported that the number of rioters outside the stadium \\\"grew to around 400 to 500 hooligans\\\".[819] A common figure is that 400 supporters of FC Berlin arrived at the S-Bahn station after kick-off.[823][802][825][264] A supporter of FC Berlin has said in Zeit that there were almost 500 supporters of FC Berlin outside the stadium.[265]\\n Another legend tells that Erich Mielke made a remark about bringing the title to Berlin after the fractious encounter between Dynamo Dresden and BFC Dynamo on 2 December 1978, when he allegedly walked into the locker room of Dynamo Dresden and told the players that \\\"You must understand, the capital city needs a champion!\\\".[923] However, according to another version, he instead made this remark when the players of Dynamo Dresden celebrated their title in 1978 and he allegedly ghosted into their locker room to inform them that BFC Dynamo will be champions next year.[924] And according to yet another version, this happened instead after BFC Dynamo had won its second title in 1980, when Erich Mielke allegedly told the players of Dynamo Dresden that \\\"One must understand, the capital city needs a champion.\\\"[178] Dynamo Dresden was one point ahead of BFC Dynamo before the last match day of the 1979-80 DDR-Oberliga. BFC Dynamo met Dynamo Dresden home in the last matchday on 10 May 1980. BFC Dynamo won the match 1-0 and captured the league title. Dynamo Dresden player Udo Schmuck remembers how Mielke came into the locker room of Dynamo Dresden after the match with a gold medal around his neck. He allegedly said: \\\"It doesn\'t matter. The main thing is that Dynamo is champion!\\\".[925] Mielke is also said to have told Dynamo Dresden player Hans-Jürgen Dörner at the same occasion; \\\"Comrade Dörner, it is clear to all of you that the title belongs in the capital, now it\'s the turn of the BFC.\\\"[926]\\n Former SG Dynamo Dresden coach Klaus Sammer claimed in an interview with Berliner Zeitung in 2003 that with \\\"a few exceptions\\\", SG Dynamo Dresden was only able to fall back on the Bezirk Dresden as catchment area.[929] However, Bezirk Dresden was one of the most populous regional districts in East Germany. East German sports journalist Horst Friedemann claims that the SV Dynamo sports communities (SG) of Eisleben and Halle/Neustadt also belonged to the catchment area of SG Dynamo Dresden. They were located under the \\\"southern line\\\", where Dresden had access.[930] SG Dynamo Dresden also had access to training centers (TZ) of SV Dynamo. SV Dynamo operated numerous training centers across East Germany. The training centers were either assigned to BFC Dynamo or SG Dynamo Dresden, depending on catchment area.[931] In total, SG Dynamo Dresden had 35 partner associations (German: Partnervereine), including training centers (TZ). Their task was mainly to scout the best players and then send them to Dresden.[932] German sports historian Hanns Leske has categorized SG Dynamo Dresden as the third most privileged football club or sports community in East German football, behind FC Vorwärts Berlin and BFC Dynamo.[933]\\n Supporters of 1. FC Union Berlin used the same provocation at away matches in Saxony, despite their cultivation of their club\'s underdog image. A supporter of 1. FC Union Berlin has testified that they brought Cuban organges and rotten bananas to an away match against FC Karl-Marx-Stadt, fully aware that these fruits were symbols of their privileges as East Berliners.[962]\\n BFC Dynamo was officially a club of the Ministry of the Interior.[973] The official sponsor (German: Träger) of the club was the Volkspolizei.[36] The official sponsor of Union Berlin was the state-owned combine VVB Hochspannungsgeräte und Kabel.[974]\\n The football clubs had been assigned one or two districts in East Germany as catchment areas at their founding. 1. FC Union Berlin had been assigned Bezirk Potsdam and one third of all training centers (TZ) in East Berlin. BFC Dynamo had been assigned Bezirk Cottbus and one third of training centers (TZ) in East Berlin. BFC Dynamo now had access to Bezirk Cottbus and two thirds of all training centers (TZ) in East Berlin. 1. FC Union Berlin on the other hand had to make do with its training centers (TZ) in East Berlin.[35][970]\\n FC Vorwärts Berlin was initially a focus club in East Berlin.[1000] The only major club in East Berlin that was never appointed as focus club was 1. FC Union Berlin.[60] FC Vorwärts Berlin continued to be part of the group of focus clubs after its relocation to Frankfurt an der Oder.[1000]\\n Football clubs were given performance assignments from the DTSB that had to be fulfilled. The clubs then had to report on the fulfillment in two-year analyzes. Union Berlin had the objective in 1977-78 of producing four players who could be delegated to the focus club BFC Dynamo. Union Berlin explained that its downward trend in the youth area was due to the fact that the club had to delegate its two best players to the focus club every year and that the club could only rely on four districts in East Berlin for further selection.[978]\\n The club management of 1. FC Union Berlin seriously considered moving all matches to Stadion der Weltjugend after a stormy encounter with BSG Wismut Aue in 1976.[1007]\\n Manfred Kirste was the first president and is the longest serving president. He served as president from 15 January 1966 to 30 August 1988.\\n Served as president until 19 Februari 1990.[1064]\\n Became acting president after the dismissal of Herbert Krafft on 19 February 1990. Bogs served as acting president until 27 May 1990.[1064]\\n Dr. Klaus Janz served as president until 15 October 1990.[1065] He asked to be relieved from the office due to professional stress as a lawyer. He continued as vice president.[1066]\\n Dr. Wolfgang Hösrich became president on 15 October 1990. He had a background as a club doctor for SC Dynamo Berlin and BFC Dynamo. Hösrich had previously served as vice president.[1067][1066] The presidium under Dr. Wolfgang Hösrich was replaced by a new presidium under Eberhard Landmann on 20 May 1994.[1068][1069][1070]\\n Eberhard Landmann became president on 20 May 1994.[1071] Landmann was a former insurance salesman. He only served as president for nine months.[1068][1069][1072]\\n Klaus Bittroff was elected as the new president on 10 February 1995 with the votes 73-11. Volkmar Wanski was elected as one of two vice presidents alongside re-elected Lutz Hoff.[1073][1072][1071] Bittroff had previously served as president of Wacker 04 Berlin from 1984 to 1991.[1071]\\n Became new president after the resignation of Klaus Bittroff on 14 September 1995.[287] Wanski resigned on 29 June 2000.[335][1072][1074]\\n Sports director Hans Reker was appointed acting president by the Economic council following the resignation of Volkmar Wanski on 29 June 2000.[335][1074] Karin Halsch took office as new president on 27 September 2000.[339]\\n Karin Halsch was known as Karin Seidel-Kalmutzki during the era. Served from 27 September 2000 to 25 June 2001.[339][1075]\\n Sports director Hans Reker served as acting president following the resignation of Karin Halsch on 25 June 2001.[1075][356] Hans Reker held the position of vice president in the presidium of Karin Halsch.[1076][346] He resigned together with the entire presidium on 30 October 2001.[376] An emergency board formed by André Sommer, Rayk Bernt and press spokesman Holger Zimmermann took office. The emergency board was meant to serve until the extraordinary general meeting on 26 November 2001.[376][387]\\n An emergency board formed by André Sommer, Rayk Bernt and press spokesman Holger Zimmermann took office on 1 November 2001. No new president was appointed for the transitional board.[376][387] Zimmerman soon resigned on 23 November 2001.[653] A new presidium was due to be elected on the extraordinary general meeting on 26 November 2001. However, the meeting agenda was changed with the votes 87 to 59 at the insistence of the emergency board. The meeting was converted into an information event and new elections were postponed.[653][1077] Club members collected signatures for the election of a new presidium. But the signatures would be ignored by Sommer and Bernt.[388] The Sommer and Bernt presidium was finally overthrown by supporters and the former coach of the women\'s team Volkmar Lucius after an application to the Charlottenburg district court.[388][401] The Charlottenburg district court appointed Lucius as emergency board member.[388] A new presidium was elected on the extraordinary general meeting on 31 May 2002.[1078]\\n Elected on an extraordinary general meeting on 31 May 2002.[1078]\\n Mario Weinkauf was elected president on 18 June 2004.[426] He resigned on a meeting with the presidium on 22 June 2007. He was then dismissed in a vote of no-confidence on an extra-ordinary general meeting on 23 June 2007. Mario Weinkauf was succeeded by Volkmar Wanski as interim president. Volkmar Wanski had been co-opted into the presidium and elected as the provisional successor to Mario Weinkauf on the meeting with the presidium on 22 June 2007. However the interim presidency of Volkmar Wanski was controversial. It was put into question whether his election was compliant with club statutes. Volkmar Wanski resigned after only six days.[1079][1080][1081]\\n Frank Bertron was launched as interim president by the Economic Council under Peter Meyer.[487][1081] He was presented as new president on 28 June 2007.[1081]\\n Norbert Uhlig is the second longest serving president after Manfred Kirste. Norbert Uhlig has been president since 11 October 2008.[1082]\\n German sports historian Hanns Leske writes that BFC Dynamo was able to recruit young players from the youth departments of all sports communities (SG) of SV Dynamo in East Germany, except those in Bezirk Dresden.[1110] German author Anne Hahn writes that the training centers (TZ) of SV Dynamo across East Germany were divided between BFC Dynamo and SG Dynamo Dresden. She writes that the catchment area of BFC Dynamo included the SV Dynamo sports communities (SG) of Rostock-Mitte, Neustrelitz, Fürstenwalde, Schwerin and Berlin. The best talents were brought together in these training centers and then selected in a central, multi-day screening courses.[931] Also Horst Friedemann claims that the catchment area of BFC Dynamo included the SV Dynamo sports communities (SG) of Rostock-Mitte, Neustrelitz, Fürstenwalde and Schwerin. According to Friedemann, the SV Dynamo sports communities (SG) of Eisleben and Halle/Neustadt instead belonged to the catchment area of SG Dynamo Dresden. That was the \\\"southern line\\\", where Dresden had access.[1111][1112]\\n The training centers (TZ) were the first preparatory stage for the support of children found suitable for sports. Training in training centers usually started at the age of 10.[1115] The training course usually lasted for three to four years.[1115] From the training centers, the best young talents could then be delegated to a Children and Youth Sports School (KJS) and a Sports club (SC) or a Football club (FC).[1116][1113][1117]\\nReferences\\nTemplate:Reflist\\n\\nFurther reading\\nTemplate:Cite news\\nBertram, Marco (2015).

V., commonly abbreviated to BFC Dynamo (German pronunciation: [beːʔɛfˌt͡seː dyˈnaːmo] (listen)) or BFC (German pronunciation: [beːʔɛfˈt͡seː] (listen)), alternatively sometimes called Dynamo Berlin, is a German football club based in the locality of Alt-Hohenschönhausen of the borough of Lichtenberg of Berlin. BFC Dynamo was founded in 1966 from the football department of SC Dynamo Berlin and became one of the most successful clubs in East German football. The club is the record champion of East Germany with ten consecutive league championships from 1979 through 1988. BFC Dynamo competes in the fourth tier Regionalliga Nordost. The club enjoys a cross-city rivalry with 1. FC Union Berlin and a historical rivalry with SG Dynamo Dresden. The rivalry with Union Berlin is part of the Berlin derby.\\n\\nHistory\\nBackgrund, founding and rise (1954–1978)\\nMain article: History of Berliner FC Dynamo (1954–1978)\\nBackground: SC Dynamo Berlin (1954–1966)\\nBFC Dynamo started as a football department of sports club SC Dynamo Berlin. SC Dynamo Berlin was founded on 1 October 1954 as one of the new elite sports clubs in East Germany.[2] The sports club was affiliated to sport association SV Dynamo. In order to establish a competitive side in Berlin, the team of SG Dynamo Dresden and its place in the DDR-Oberliga was transferred to the new sports club SC Dynamo Berlin. The relocation was designed to give the capital a team that would rival teams from West Berlin such as Hertha BSC, which were still popular in East Berlin.[3][4][5][nb 1][nb 2]\\n\\n\\nGünter Schröter (left), Horst Kohle of ASK Vorwärts Berlin (centre) and Martin Skaba (right) during a match between Vorwärts Berlin and Dynamo Berlin at the Walther-Ulbricht-Stadion on 18 October 1959\\nThe team played its first match as SC Dynamo Berlin against BSG Rotation Babelsberg in the 1954-55 DDR-Oberliga on 21 November 1954. Among the players delegated from SG Dynamo Dresden were Johannes Matzen, Herbert Schoen and Günter Schröter. SC Dynamo Berlin finished its first season in the DDR-Oberliga in seventh place. The team was relatively successful in the 1955 DDR-Oberliga, but suffered relegation to the second tier DDR-Liga after the 1956 DDR-Oberliga. SC Dynamo Berlin played a friendly match against Polish side Górniczy KS Szombierki Bytom in front of 80,000 spectators at the Walter-Ulricht-Stadion on 9 May 1957.[18][19] The attendance number is allegedly the highest in the history of the club.[19][nb 3] SC Dynamo Berlin eventually finished the 1957 DDR-Liga in first place immediately returned to the DDR-Oberliga.\\n\\nGünter Schröter and Herbert Maschke would remain central players to the team into early the 1960s. But most other players of the former SG Dynamo Dresden team were no longer active in the team by the late 1950s.[21] Herbert Schoen had played his last competitive matches for the team during the 1957 season and Johannes Matzen had suffered a serious injury during the 1958 season and consequently had to end his playing career.[22] The team was now instead shaped by a new generation of players, including Martin Skaba, Werner Heine, Waldemar Mühlbächer, Hermann Bley and Konrad Dorner (de).[23]\\n\\n\\nThe team of SC Dynamo Berlin after winning the 1959 FDGB-Pokal, at the Bruno-Plache-Stadion in Leipzig on 13 December 1959\\nSC Dynamo Berlin had difficulties establishing itself in football in East Berlin.[17] The team rarely drawing crowds larger than 5,000 spectators at the Walter-Ulbricht-Stadion. SC Dynamo Berlin finally won its first trophy in the 1959 FDGB-Pokal. However, the team would not be allowed to participate in the 1960-61 European Cup Winners\' Cup. The East German Football Association (DFV) found local rival and league runner-up ASK Vorwärts Berlin to be a more suitable representative of East Germany in the competition.[24]\\n\\nSC Dynamo Berlin also had some success in the first seasons of the 1960s. The team fished the 1960 DDR-Oberliga as runner-up. SC Dynamo Berlin was a top team also in the 1961-62 DDR-Oberliga. The team participated in the 1961–62 International Football Cup during the summer of 1961. SC Dynamo Berlin was successful in 1961-62 FDGB-Pokal. The team was only defeated 1-3 by SC Chemie Halle in the final.[25] However, SC Dynamo Berlin still found itself overshadowed in the capital by the army-sponsored ASK Vorwärts Berlin.[26] The team of SC Dynamo Berlin during the 1960s would eventually prove relatively weak.[27] SC Dynamo Berlin had become a lower table side by the end of the 1962–63 Oberliga.[21]\\n\\nEast German football was reformed in 1965–66, when the football departments of ten sports clubs (SC) were made independent from their sports clubs to form ten dedicated football clubs. The new designated football clubs (FC) would form the elite of East German football. As part of the reorganization, the football section of SC Dynamo Berlin was separated from the sports club and reorganized as football club BFC Dynamo.[28][29][4][30] The football department of sports community SG Dynamo Hohenschönhausen was also disbanded after the 1965–66 season. The players of SG Dynamo Hochenschönhausen joined the reserve team BFC Dynamo II and BFC Dynamo II took over the place of SG Dynamo Hohenschönhausen in the 1966-67 Bezirksliga Berlin.\\n\\nFounding and second relegation (1966–1967)\\nBFC Dynamo was founded on 15 January 1966.[31] The new club was presented by the President of SV Dynamo Erich Mielke at a ceremony in the Dynamo-Sporthalle in Hohenschönhausen in East Berlin.[32] The first presidium included the Head of the Volkspolizei in East Berlin Horst Ende, the Intendant of the Metropol theatre Hans Pitra, former DDR-Oberliga player Johannes Matzen and the Editor-in-chief of the East German football weekly Die Neue Fußballwoche (FuWo) (de) Klaus Schlegel.[33] Manfred Kirste was elected club president and Mielke was elected honorary president.[32][31] Kirste came from Berlin and was a certified sports teacher.[34]\\n\\n\\nThe match between BFC Dynamo and FC Vorwärts Berlin in the DDR-Oberliga at the Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum on 13 August 1966\\nThe new designated football clubs (FC) were formed as centers of excellence in East German football, with the right to draw on talents within designated geographical and administrative areas.[4][29] BFC Dynamo was initiallly assigned Bezirk Cottbus and one third of East Berlin as catchment area.[35] BFC Dynamo was officially a club of the Ministry of the Interior, and the club\'s official sponsor was the Volkspolizei.[36][37] However, the honorary chairman Mielke was the head of the Stasi and most of the club\'s sponsoring members would eventually be made up of Stasi employees. BFC Dynamo would come to receive personal, organizational and financial support from the Stasi.[37][38] Research by the Stasi Records Agency has shown that 31 employees of the Ministry of the Interior and ten employees of the Stasi would eventually be involved in the club.[39]\\n\\nSC Dynamo Berlin had been in first place in the 1965-66 DDR-Oberliga after the eighth matchday.[40] BFC Dynamo were still in a good fourth place after a 2–0 win over BSG Chemie Leipzig on the 23rd matchday on 16 April 1966. However, the team then lost its last three matches in the league, against F.C. Hansa Rostock, SG Dynamo Dresden and FC Rot-Weiß Erfurt, and finished the season in ninth place.[41]\\n\\nHungarian Bela Volentik was new coach for the 1966–67 season. The team played a friendly match against Polish side Pogoń Szczecin on 10 September 1966. The match would be one of many in a long series of friendly maches against Pogoń Szczecin during the East German era.[42][nb 4] The team struggled in the 1966-67 DDR-Oberliga. BFC Dynamo faced local rivals 1. FC Union Berlin away on the 22nd matchday on 26 April 1967. BFC Dynamo was in 13th place in the league and threatened with relegation.[44][45] Supporters of 1. FC Union Berlin mocked the team with a banner saying \\\"We greet the relegated\\\". 1. FC Union Berlin won the match 3-0 and BFC Dynamo was now practically relegated.[45] The match is seen as the starting point for the feud between the two clubs.[45] BFC Dynamo eventually finished the 1966-67 DDR-Oberliga in 13th place and was again relegated to the DDR-Liga. Long-time player Waldemar Mühlbächer retired from his playing career after the season.[46] Mühlbächer had joined SC Dynamo Berlin in 1956 and had played 11 seasons for the team.[47]\\n\\nRejuvenation and first UEFA competition (1967–1972)\\nFormer SC Dynamo Berlin forward Karl Schäffner returned as coach for the 1967–68 season.[48] BFC Dynamo dominated the 1967-68 DDR-Liga Nord. The team was undefeated during the second half of the league season and immediately won promotion back to the DDR-Oberliga.[49] Forward Peter Lyszczan became tied league top goalscorer in the 1967-68 DDR-Liga Nord with 19 goals.[50] Martin Skaba and Hermann Bley retired after the 1967–68 season and Konrad Dorner was transferred to the reserve team BFC Dynamo II.[51] The three had joined SC Dynamo Berlin between 1956 and 1958. Skaba had played in a total of 343 matches for the team.[52]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo began a rejuvenation of the team during the 1967–68 season.[51] Among the players from the youth department who got to play matches in the 1967-68 DDR-Liga Nord were Harald Schütze (de), Norbert Johannsen and Werner Voigt.[53] BFC Dynamo fielded a young team in the 1968–69 season. The average age of the team was 23 years at the start of the season.[54] Harald Schütze was now a regular player in the team.[51] BFC Dynamo got off to a difficult start on its return to the DDR-Oberliga. Hans Geitel took over as coach for the second half of the season. Geitel had previously worked in the youth academy of BFC Dynamo.[55] The team finished the 1968-69 DDR-Oberliga in tenth place.\\n\\nBFC Dynamo recruited young forward Ralf Schulenberg from FC Rot-Weiß Erfurt for the 1969–70 season.[56] Schulenberg was probably compensation for the talented Günter Wolff, who had left BFC Dynamo for FC Rot-Weiß Erfurt after the 1967–68 season.[55] A number of players from the youth departments would also make their debut in the DDR-Oberliga in the following seasons, such as Peter Rohde (de) in 1969, Frank Terletzki in 1969 and Bernd Brillat in 1970. BFC Dynamo reached the final of the 1970-71 FDGB-Pokal. The team lost the final 1–2 in overtime to SG Dynamo Dresden, but qualified for the next season\'s UEFA Cup Winners\' Cup as runner-up.[57] This time, the team would also be allowed to participate in the competition, unlike in 1960. BFC Dynamo was thus finally ready for its first participation in an UEFA competition.[58]\\n\\nA number of football clubs became specially promoted focus clubs (German: Schwerpunktclubs) in the 1970 DFV Football Resolution (German: DFV-Fußballbeschluss).[59][60] BFC Dynamo and FC Vorwärts Berlin became focus clubs in East Berlin.[60][61] The football landscape in East Berlin would then change dramatically ahead of the 1971–72 season, when the Ministry of Defense decided to relocate FC Vortwärts Berlin to Frankfurt an der Oder.[62][63] BFC Dynamo and 1. FC Union Berlin were from now on the only major football clubs in East Berlin.[64] BFC Dynamo would be allowed to take over the catchment area in East Berlin that had previously belonged to FC Vorwärts Berlin.[65][64] The team would also have the opportunity to play more matches at the larger and more centrally located Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark in Prenzlauer Berg, which led to increased interest in the club and growing attendance numbers.[66]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo stood out among other teams within SV Dynamo. BFC Dynamo was located at the frontline of the Cold War. It was also a representative of the East German capital. This meant that the club had to be well equipped.[67] BFC Dynamo would eventually get access to a nationwide scouting network, including numerous training centers (German: Trainingszentrum) (TZ) of SV Dynamo across East Germany.[68][nb 5] BFC Dynamo would eventually be able to recruit young talented players from 38 training centers (TZ) across East Germany. By comparison, 1. FC Union Berlin only had access to 6 training centers (TZ), all of which were located in the Berlin area.[70]\\n\\nThe team was joined by forward Wolf-Rüdiger Netz from SG Dynamo Schwerin for the 1971–72 season. Among the central players in the team in the 1971–72 season were Werner Lihsa, Harald Schütze, Frank Terletzki, Dieter Stumpf, Norbert Johannsen, Peter Rohde, Wilfried Trümpler, Joachen Carow, Wolf-Rüdiger Netz and Ralf Schulenberg.[71] BFC Dynamo had success in the 1971–72 UEFA Cup Winners\' Cup. The team eliminated Cardiff City F.C. in the first round and then K Beerschot VA in the second round. BFC Dynamo would now also show its strength in the DDR-Oberliga. The team was unbeaten in the first six league matches after the winter break, including wins against top teams 1. FC Magdeburg and SG Dynamo Dresden.[72] The team eliminated Åtvidabergs FF in the quarter-finals of the 1971–72 UEFA Cup Winners\' Cup and advanced to the semi-finals.[73] BFC Dynamo thus became the first team from Berlin to reach the semi-finals in one of the two most prestigious UEFA competitions (the European Cup and the European Cup Winners\' Cup). BFC Dynamo was eventually eliminated by Dynamo Moscow in the semi-finals after a penalty shoot-out at the Druzhba Stadium in Lviv in the return leg on 20 April 1972.[74] The team finished the 1971-72 DDR-Oberliga as runner-up.\\n\\nRise in the DDR-Oberliga (1972–1978)\\nBFC Dynamo was qualified for the 1972-73 UEFA Cup. The team eliminated Angers SCO and Levski Sofia in the first two rounds. BFC Dynamo was then set to play Liverpool F.C. in the third round. The first leg ended 0–0 in front of 20,000 spectators at the Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum on 29 November 1972.[75] The team was eventually eliminated after a 1–3 defeat at Anfield on 13 December 1972. BFC Dynamo saw a decline in the league and finished 1972-73 DDR-Oberliga in sixth place. The talented 17-year-old forward Hans-Jürgen Riediger from the youth department made his debut for BFC Dynamo in the DDR-Oberliga at the end of the 1972–73 season.[76]\\n\\n\\nThe match between BFC Dynamo and F.C. Hansa Rostock at the Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum on 28 September 1974.\\nHarry Nippert became the new coach for the 1973–74 season.[77] Günter Schröter became his assistant.[78] Nippert had once played for SC Dynamo Berlin.[79] He had recently served as assistant to famous SG Dynamo Dresden coach Walter Fritzsch from 1969 to 1973.[80] BFC Dynamo recruited attacking midfielder and national team player Reinhard Lauck from relegated 1. FC Union Berlin for of the 1973–74 season.[78] Numerous players were tried during the season. Not a single player played all 26 league matches during the 1973–74 season.[81] The team finished also the 1973-74 DDR-Oberliga in sixth place. Martin Skaba became the new assistant coach for the 1974–75 season.[82] BFC Dynamo recruited young defender Michael Noack (de) from relegated BSG Energie Cottbus for the season.[82] League results improved and BFC Dynamo finished the 1974-75 DDR-Oberliga in fourth place. Several players from the youth department made their debuts for BFC Dynamo in DDR-Oberliga during the 1974–75 season: Lutz Eigendorf, Roland Jüngling (de) and Norbert Trieloff.[83][84][85]\\n\\n\\nHans-Jürgen Riediger in the match between BFC Dynamo and 1.

Terletzki had played in a total of 489 matches for BFC Dynamo since 1969.[172]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo had the best material conditions in the league and the best team by far.[173] But controversial refereeing decisions in favor of BFC Dynamo gave rise to speculation that the dominance of BFC Dynamo was not solely due to athletic performance, but also due to help from referees.[174] BFC Dynamo was a representative of both the Stasi and the capital. The team was therefore viewed with more suspicion than affection.[175][174] The overbearing success of BFC Dynamo in the 1980s made fans of opposing teams easily aroused as to what they saw as manipulation by bent referees.[173][176] The team was met with aggression and shouts such as \\\"Bent champions!\\\" (German: Schiebermeister) and \\\"Jews Berlin!\\\" at away matches.[177][4][178][179] Complaints of alleged referee bias accumulated.[173][4][180] The German Football Association of the GDR (DFV) eventually conducted a secret review of the 1984-85 DDR-Oberliga.[173][167][181] Among other things, the review found that BFC Dynamo had earned only one third of the yellow cards incurred by rival SG Dynamo Dresden.[182][183][181] A review was also made of the final of the 1984-85 FDGB-Pokal final between BFC Dynamo and SG Dynamo Dresden. This review found that 30 percent of the referee decisions were wrong, and that 80 percent of those had been of disadvantage to SG Dynamo Dresden.[184][185][186][181] A number of referees were sanctioned for their performances in matches involving BFC Dynamo in the following months, including the referees involved in the cup final.[4][186][181]\\n\\nA particularly controversial episode was the penalty awarded to BFC Dynamo by referee Bernd Stumpf in extra time in the match between 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig and BFC Dynamo on 22 March 1986. The penalty caused a wave of protests.[167][187][174] SED General Secretary Erich Honecker and Secretary for Security, Youth and Sport of the SED Central Committee Egon Krenz were fed up with the \\\"football question\\\" and the \\\"BFC-discussion\\\".[167] An example was consequently made out of referee Stumpf. He was permanently banned from refereeing by the DFV.[165] The sanctions against Stumpf were approved by Honecker and Krenz in the SED Central Committee.[188][189] However, a previously unknown video recording of the match was published by Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk (MDR) in 2000. The video recording showed that the penalty was correctly awarded and that the sanctions against Stumpf were unjustified.[165][178][190]\\n\\n\\\"I can imagine there was referee manipulation due to the immense pressure from the government and Ministry for State Security. That could have made some referees nervous and influenced their decisions. But we were the strongest team at the time. We didn\'t need their help.\\\"\\n\\nFalko Götz[191]\\nThe benefit of controlling important matches in Western Europe might have put indirect pressure on the referees to take preventive measures, in so-called preventive obedience.[192][193][194][195][175] In order pursue an international career, a referee would need a travel permit, confirmed by the Stasi.[188][181][196] It become known after the German reunification that several referees had also been Unofficial collaborators (IM) of the Stasi.[167][197][198][199] However, there is no evidence to show that referees were under direct instructions from the Stasi and no document has ever been found in the archives that gave the Stasi a mandate to bribe referees.[197][194][200][201]\\n\\nThe picture that the success of BFC Dynamo relied upon referee bias is dismissed by former BFC Dynamo players and coaches. Some of them admit that there might have been cases of referee bias, but they all insist that it was the thoroughness of their youth work and the quality of their play that earned them their titles.[202][174][191][203] Former coach Jürgen Bogs has said: \\\"You cannot postpone 26 matches in one season in the DDR-Oberliga. At that time we had the best football team\\\".[204][190][nb 6] BFC Dynamo was able to filter the best talents through nationwide screening and train them in its youth academy. The youth academy had full-time trainers employed for every age group.[206] As a trainer of the DDR-Oberliga team, Bogs worked with modern training methods, such as video evalutations, which was not yet common in East Germany. The club also applied heart rate and lactate measurements during training, which only came to the Bundesliga many years later.[207][190] Former referee Bernd Heynemann has concluded: \\\"The BFC is not ten times champions because the referees only whistled for Dynamo. They were already strong as a bear.\\\"[208]\\n\\nLast titles in East Germany (1986–1989)\\n\\nMarco Köller (left) and Heiko Scholz of 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig (right) during the match between the two teams on 22 August 1987.\\nFrank Rohde was the new team captain for the 1986–87 season.[209] BFC Dynamo recruited 20-year-old attacking midfielder Thomas Doll from relegated F.C. Hansa Rostock for of the 1986–87 season.[209] Doll and Andreas Thom would form one of the most effective attacking duos in East German football in the late 1980s. BFC Dynamo defeated 1. FC Union Berlin 8–1 in the derby on the fourth matchday of the 1986-87 DDR-Oberliga.[210][211] The East Germany U19 team won the 1986 UEFA European Under-18 Championship, after defeating Italy 3–1 in the final on 15 October 1986. BFC Dynamo was represented by two youth players in the squad: midfielder Marco Köller and defender Hendrik Herzog.[212] [213] Köller and Herzog would then make their debuts for BFC Dynamo in the DDR-Oberliga during the 1986–87 season.[214][215] The team met fierce competition from 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig in the 1986–87 DDR-Oberliga. BFC Dynamo met 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig away on the 20th matchday at the Bruno-Plache-Stadion on 11 April 1987.[216] The two teams had the same number of points going into the match.[217] BFC Dynamo won the match 1–3.[216] The team eventually finished the 1986-87 DDR-Oberliga in first place, 6 points ahead of runner-up SG Dynamo Dresden and 8 points ahead of third-placed 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig.[218]\\n\\n\\nAndreas Thom during a match against SG Dynamo Dresden on 6 April 1988.\\nBFC Dynamo was eliminated in the first round of the 1987-88 European Cup after double defeats against FC Girondins de Bordeaux. Also the 1987-88 DDR-Oberliga meant firece competition from 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig. BFC Dynamo finished the first half of the season as Herbstmeister. The team had the same number of points as second-placed 1. FC Lokomotiv Leipzig and led the league only on goal difference.[219] Andreas Thom was the top scorer in the league by a wide margin, with 14 goals in 13 games in the first half of the season.[220] The second half of the 1987-88 DDR-Oberliga was a tight race against 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig until the end. BFC Dynamo and 1. FC Lokomotive were level on points heading into the final matchday, but BFC Dynamo had the better goal difference.[221] BFC Dynamo defeated FC Vorwärts Frankfurt 1–0 at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark on the final matchday and won its tenth consecutive DDR-Oberliga title. The winning goal was scored by Burkhard Reich.[222] The team then defeated FC Carl Zeiss Jena 2–0 in front of 40,000 spectators at the Stadion der Weltjugend in the final of the 1987–88 FDGB-Pokal and finally completed the Double.[223] Andreas Thom was eventually voted the 1988 East German footballer of the year.[224]\\n\\n\\nAndreas Thom receiving the 1988 East German footballer of the year award from the Die Neue Fußballwoche (de) editor-in-chief Jürgen Nöldner on 13 August 1988.\\nLong-time club president Manfred Kirste was replaced by Herbert Krafft ahead of the 1988–89 season.[225] Krafft had a background in the Volkspolizei.[226] BFC Dynamo was drawn against West German champions SV Werder Bremen in the first round of the 1988-89 European Cup. The first match was played at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark. Among the spectators was the former West German Chancellor Willy Brandt. BFC Dynamo sensationally won the match 3–0.[227] Bodo Rudwaleit was a match hero, with numerous saves.[228] However, the team lost the return leg at the Weser-Stadion with 5–0. The return leg in Bremen would become known as the second \\\"Miracle on the Weser\\\".[228][227] It has been rumored that the spectacular loss in the return leg was explained by BFC Dynamo having been given doping before the home game in East Berlin.[105][229] A more likely explanation, however, is that the players could not cope with the enormous pressure before the return leg.[229] It has also been rumored that the players were distracted from their pre-match preparations by shopping opportunities, which had been arranged by SV Werder Bremen manager Willi Lemke.[229][230] BFC Dynamo lost important points to its league rivals in the autumn and finished the first half of the season in fourth place, a full nine points behind SG Dynamo Dresden. It was the team\'s worst result after a first half of the season in the league in 14 years.[231]\\n\\nAverage attendance had dropped from 15,000 to 9,000 during the team\'s most successful years in the 1980s.[173] Ordinary fans feared the Stasi and had become disillusioned with political interference. Particularly aggravating were the restrictions on ticket sales that the Stasi imposed at international matches for political reasons. Only a few tickets were sold to ordinary fans for matches in the European Cup against opponents such as Hamburger SV and SV Werder Bremen. The majority was instead sold to a politically hand-picked audience.[190][232] BFC Dynamo also saw the emergence of a well-organized hooligan scene during the 1980s.[174][178] The development was partly a response to the increasing state repression against the supporter scene.[190]\\n\\n\\nThe team celebrates the victory in the 1988-89 FDGB-Pokal at the Stadion der Weltjugend on 1 April 1989.\\nBFC Dynamo met local rival 1. FC Union Berlin on the 16th matchday of the 1988-89 DDR-Oberliga on 18 March 1989. 1. FC Union Berlin now fielded as many as four former BFC Dynamo players in the starting line-up: Olaf Seier, Mario Maek, Thomas Grether and Norbert Trieloff.[233] BFC Dynamo reached the final of the FDGB-Pokal for the second consecutive season. The team met Karl-Marx-Stadt in the final of the 1988-89 FDGB-Pokal. BFC Dynamo won the match 1–0 in front of 35,000 spectators at the Stadion de Weltjugend and captured its second consecutive cup title. The winning goal was scored by Anderas Thom in the 57th minute.[234] BFC Dynamo eventually finished the 1988-89 DDR-Oberliga as runner-up. Defender Jens-Uwe Zöphel and midfielder Jörn Lenz from the youth department made their debuts for BFC Dynamo in the DDR-Oberliga during the 1988–89 season.[235][236]\\n\\nHelmut Jäschke replaced Jürgen Bogs as coach for the 1989–90 season.[237] As the winner of the 1988-89 FDGB-Pokal, BFC Dynamo was set to play the DFV-Supercup against new league champions SG Dynamo Dresden. The match was played at the Stadion der Freundschaft in Cottbus on 5 August 1989.[238] BFC Dynamo won the match 4-1 and thus became the first and only winner of the DFV-Supercup in the history of East German football.\\n\\nGerman reunification and decline (1989–2004)\\nMain article: History of Berliner FC Dynamo (1989–2004)\\nThe Peaceful revolution, FC Berlin and failed promotion (1989–1991)\\n\\nThe new BFC Dynamo coach Helmut Jäschke during the match against FC Rot-Weiß Erfurt on the first matchday of the 1989-90 DDR-Oberliga on 12 August 1989\\nThe 1989–90 season was tumultuous for BFC Dynamo. Frank Pastor was transferred to BSG Aktivist Schwarze Pumpe at the beginning of the season. BFC Dynamo was qualified for the 1989–90 European Cup Winners\' Cup as winners of the 1988–89 FDGB-Pokal. The team was eliminated in the second round by AS Monaco on the away goals rule. Coach Helmut Jäschke then decided to place young goalkeeper Oskar Kosche in the following match. Long-time goalkeeper Bodo Rudwaleit ten suddenly announced his immediate retirement from football.[239] The East German regime faltered under pressure from political mass demonstrations and events in neighboring countries. Parts of the Berlin Wall were opened on 9 November 1989 and East German citizens could now freely travel to West Berlin. The Stasi was transformed into the Office for National Security (German: Amt für Nationale Sicherheit) (AfNS) on 17 November 1989.[240] The transformation also ended the tenure of Erich Mielke as Minister of State Security.[241] He would soon be dismissed as the First Chairman of SV Dynamo as well.[242][226] Andreas Thom was signed to Bayer Leverkusen by Bayer Leverkusen manager Reiner Calmund. The transfer became official on 12 December 1989. Thom thus became the first player in the DDR-Oberliga to leave for the West German Bundesliga.[243] The transfer fee amounted to 2,5 million Deutsche Mark.[243]\\n\\n\\nThe team of FC Berlin at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark on 23 February 1990.\\nBodo Rudwaleit was transferred to BSG Stahl Einsenhüttenstadt and Bernd Schulz to BSG Bergmann-Borsig during the 1989–1990 winter break. The dismantling of the team from the 1980s was now well underway.[244] Coach Jäschke was dismissed during the winter break and was replaced by Peter Rohde.[245] Rohde had played 159 league- and 14 international matches for BFC Dynamo between 1969 and 1978 and was an older brother of team captain Frank Rohde.[245] The AfNS was eventually completely dissolved on 13 January 1990.[240] With the dissolution of the Stasi, BFC Dynamo had lost a major sponsor. The Ministry of the Interior announced that it was only prepared to support the club until the end of the 1989–90 season.[246][247][248] The fate of the club was uncertain. BFC Dynamo was rebranded as FC Berlin on 19 February 1990.[249][250] Club President Herbert Krafft was dismissed at the same time and Jürgen Bogs took over as interim president until new club elections could be held.[249] The team participated in the first edition of the indoor tournament \\\"Internationales Berliner Hallenfussballurnier\\\" in the Werner-Seelenbinder-Halle. Teams from West Berlin, such as Hertha BSC also participated. FC Berlin lost the final against arch-rival 1. FC Union Berlin with 4–5. Thomas Doll became the best goal scorer of the tournament with 12 goals.[251] The second half of the season started well, but it soon became clear that FC Berlin would not would not have a chance at the title.[252] FC Berlin finished the 1989-90 DDR-Oberliga in fourth place and failed for the first time in a long time to qualify for a European tournament.[253] Attendance dropped from 7,271 in the fall of 1989 to just 3,383 in the spring of 1990.[254] The team lost Thomas Doll and Frank Rohde to Hamburger SV and Rainer Ernst to 1. FC Kaiserslautern after the season.[255][256]\\n\\n\\nDirk Rehbein chasing the ball during a match between FC Berlin and HFC Chemie at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark on 10 November 1990.\\nThe team was joined by Dirk Rehbein from SC Fortuna Köln during the summer of 1990. FC Berlin participated in the 1990 Intertoto Cup 30 June 1990 and 17 July 1990. FC Berlin had sold off almost all its offensive players during the 1989–90 season and the team finished the tournament in third place.[257][258][259] FC Berlin also recruited Mikhail Pronichev from FC Lokomotiv Moscow for the 1990–91 season.[260][261] The team began the 1990-91 NOFV-Oberliga with four consecutive defeats and was in last place in the league after the fourth matchday. Jürgen Bogs returned as coach.[262][263] A wave of hooliganism swept through East Germany in 1990.[178] One of the largest hooligan scenes in Germany was formed around FC Berlin.[253] 18-year-old FC Berlin supporter Mike Polley was shot dead by police during riots in Leutzsch in connection with the match between FC Sachsen Leipzig and FC Berlin on 3 November 1990. The police had fired between 50 and 100 shots in one minute.[264] The hooligan scene of FC Berlin would shape the entire 1990–91 season.[265] FC Berlin continued to struggle in the second half of the league season. The team was in 12th place in the league towards the end of the season.[266] However, FC Berlin won its last two matches in the league, against Chemnitzer FC and FC Victoria 91 Frankfurt, and finished the 1990-91 NOFV-Oberliga in 11th place.[266] The team was thus qualified for the play-off for the 2. Bundesliga. FC Berlin was one point behind leaders BSV Stahl Brandeburg before the final round. The team defeated 1. FC Magdeburg 3–5 away, but BSV Stahl Brandenburg defeated 1. FC Union Berlin 0–2 away. FC Berlin thus finished in second place and just narrowly failed to qualify for the 2. Bundesliga.[267][268][257] The team lost several key-players after the season, such as Heiko Bonan, Burkhard Reich, Waldemar Ksienzyk, Thorsten Boer, Eike Küttner and Hendrik Herzog.[268][269]\\n\\nDecline (1991-1994)\\nFC Berlin recruited midfielder Ralf Rambow from Eisenhüttenstädter FC Stahl for the 1991–92 season. The 1991–92 season was the first season when teams from East Germany and teams from West Germany played in the same league system. The NOFV-Oberliga was now at third tier in the league system. FC Berlin was qualified for the 1991-92 DFB-Pokal as a participant in the 1990–91 2. Bundesliga play-off. It was the club\'s first participation in the DFB-Pokal. The team was drawn against SC Freiburg. The starting eleven included players such as Oskar Kosche, Christian Backs, Jens-Uwe Zöphel, Jörg Fügner, Mario Tolkmitt and Mikhail Pronichev. FC Berlin lost the match 0–2.[270] Heiko Brestrich returned to the team during the summer of 1991.[271] Brestrich would be a key-player of FC Berlin in the 1990s. FC Berlin came to dominate the 1991-92 NOFV-Oberliga. The team lost only two matches during the entire league season and scored a total of 97 goals.[272] FC Berlin was once again qualified for the play-off for the 2. Bundesliga. The team finished the play-off in third place. Volkswagen-backed VfL Wolfsburg won the play-off, which meant that no team from the former East Germany was able to advance.[272] FC Berlin lost 11 players after the 1991–92 season, including Mario Tolkmitt, Christian Backs, Jörn Lenz, Jörg Fügner and Oskar Kosche.[273][274] In total, FC Berlin lost two complete teams in the first one or two years after the fall of the Berlin Wall.[256]\\n\\nFailing to win win promotion to the 2. Bundesliga, FC Berlin had to continue at amateur level. The main competitors in the following seasons of the NOFV-Oberliga Nord were teams such as Tennis Borussia Berlin, BSV Stahl Brandenburg and Eisenhüttenstädter FC Stahl. With the many player departures after the 1991–92 season, Jürgen Bogs once again had to build a new team.[273] FC Berlin recruited forward Bernd Jopek for 1. FC Union Berlin and midfielder Stefan Oesker from Blau-Weiß 1890 Berlin for the 1992–93 season.[273] The team was also strengthened by a number of youth players.[273] FC Berlin now had to rely on its youth department to supply the team with new players.[275] The team finished the 1992-93 NOFV-Oberliga Nord in fourth place. Dirk Rehbein and Ralf Rambow left for 1. FC Union Berlin after the season.[276][277] FC Berlin was no longer the absolute treasure trove among former East German clubs, but continued to produce talent thanks to its excellent youth work.[277] Among the players from the youth department on the squad in 1993–94 season were Jens Reckmann, Mike Jesse, Ronny Nikol, Michael Franke, Marcell Fensch and Rayk Schröder.[278][275][273][276][277] The team of FC Berlin that played against Spandauer SV on the fifth matchday on 9 September 1993 had an avagerage age of only 21,33 and was the youngest team of BFC Dynamo to have ever played a competitive match.[279] Helmut Koch replaced Jürgen Bogs as coach on 28 September 1993.[280] FC Berlin finished the 1993-94 NOFV-Oberliga Nord in fourth place and qualified for the new Regionalliga Nordost.\\n\\nRegionalliga Nordost and first Berlin cup title (1994–1999)\\nMario Kallnik returned to the club for the 1994–95 season. The re-instated Regionalliga would now form the new third tier in the German football league system. The 1994-95 Regionalliga Nordost meant new meetings with well-known opponents such as FC Carl Zeiss Jena, 1. FC Union Berlin and FC Rot-Weiß Erfurt.[281] BFC Dynamo struggled in the 1994-95 Regionalliga Nordost, but managed to retain its place in the league.[282] Jens-Uwe Zöphel left the team for FC Energie Cottbus after the season. The team was joined by goalkeeper Daniel Bartel from the youth department for the 1995–96 season. Bartel became the new first-choice goalkeeper at the beginning of the season. The highlights of the 1995-96 Regionalliga Nordost were new meetings with old rival 1. FC Dynamo Dresden.[283] The two teams had not met since the 1990–91 season.[284][281] The first meeting was played in front of 2,002 spectators at the Stadion im Sportforum on 8 September 1995. The score was 1–3 at half break.[283] The match ended 4–3 to 1. FC Dynamo Dresden.[284][281] Club President Klaus Bittroff resigned on 14 September 1995 and Vice president Volkmar Wanski became the new club president.[285] The team had a difficult start to the 1995-95 Regionalliga Nordost. Due to acute danger of relegation, coach Koch was dismissed on 17 October 1995. Werner Voigt became the new coach.[286][287] Voigt had a long background in the club as a player and coach. With Voigt, the experienced defender Mario Maek also returned to the club.[286] FC Berlin organized one of the biggest youth football tournaments so far in the eastern part of the country in the Sportforum Hohenschönhausen on 6–8 April 1996. As many as 30 youth teams from clubs such as Chelsea F.C., Everton F.C., Feyenoord, FC Bayern München and Borussia Dortmund participated.[288][287] FC Berlin found itself in the relegation zone towards the end of the 1995-95 Regionalliga Nordost.[289] The place in the league was saved with a 1–0 win over FSV Wacker 90 Nordhausen on the 33rd matchday, 19 May 1996. The winning goal was scored by Mario Maek.[283]\\n\\nExperienced players such as Heiko Brestrich, Mario Maek, and Jens Reckmann would form the team\'s backbone during the 1996–67 season.[290] FC Berlin defeated 1. FC Dynamo Dresden 2–0 in the opening match of the 1996–97 Regionalliga Nordost in front of 2,300 spectators at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark.[291] Then followed a sharp decline.[292] The team would lose 6–0 away to its other rival 1. FC Union on the ninth matchday.[293] It was the biggest loss to date against 1. FC Union Berlin.[294] Club President Wanski announced on 26 November 1996 that the financial reserves had been used up.[287] The millions of Deutsche Mark that the club had made from player transfers in the early 1990s were now gone.[295] Wanski would then support the club every year with personal contributions.[296][297] During the second half of the 1995–96 season, he became shirt sponsor with his own company Regio Bautenschutz GmbH.[290] The shirts had not had a sponsor in almost seven years.[290] FC Berlin also signed a two-year sponsoring contract with the Italian sportswear manufacturer Fila during the spring of 1996, where Fila became the club\'s equipment sponsor. The club previously had no equipment sponsor.[298] Fila had reportedly been impressed by the club\'s youth work.[298] FC Berlin finished the 1996-67 Regionaliga Nordost on 13th place after another weak season. Mikhail Pronichev left the team for TuS Makkabi Berlin and Jens Reckmann for 1. FC Dynamo Dresden after the season.\\n\\nThe team recruited Croatian defender Davor Krznarić for the 1997–98 season. The 1997-98 Regionalliga Nordost was also a struggle, with the team in 12th place in the league at the winter break.[299] The club still received New Year\'s greetings from Real Madrid and Liverpool F.C. in 1997.[300] Experienced defender Jörn Lenz returned to the club during the winter break.[301] Lenz would be a key player for several seasons to come. The successes in the Regionalliga Nordost had not materialized. It became known that coach Voigt had signed for 1. FC Dynamo Dresden for the 1998–99 season. The club and Voigt decided to part ways.[302] Assistant coach Ingo Rentzsch took over on 12 March 1998.[303] The team played an exciting 5–5 draw away against 1. FC Magdeburg away on the 33rd matchday, 5 May 1998. Bernd Jopek, Jörn Lenz, Davor Krznarić, Marek Seruga, and Mario Kallnik scored one goal each in the match.[303][304] New coach for the 1998–99 season was Henry Häusler.[305] Players central to the team in the 1998–99 season were Heiko Brestrich, Jörn Lenz, Mario Maek, Martino Gatti, Mario Kallnik, Davor Krznarić, Timo Lesch, and Sven Ohly, with Lenz as team captain.[305][306] Coach Häusler was eventually dismissed on 18 March 1999 and assistant coach Ingo Rentzsch again took over as interim coach.[307] Club President Wanski came up with the idea to revive the old name BFC Dynamo during the autumn of 1998. He said: \\\"We stand by Dynamo\'s sporting tradition, we reject the club\'s political past.\\\"[308][297] An overwhelming majority at the general meeting on 8 May 1999 voted to take back the old name.[309] The team met local rival Union Berlin on the penultimate matchday of the 1998-99 Regionalliga Nordost, 8 May 1999. The team now again competed as BFC Dynamo. Coach Rentzsch threw in the towel at half-time and left the stadium, allegedly because Club President Wanski had wanted to dictate the line-up.[310][311][312] Youth trainer Norbert Paepke took over as coach in the second half of the match.[310][313] BFC Dynamo won the derby 2–0 with two goals by Marcel Solomo in front of 2,543 spectators at the Stadion an der Alten Försterei.[314] BFC Dynamo reached the final of the 1998-99 Berlin Cup. The team defeated Berlin Türkspor 1965 with 4–1 in the final on 11 May 1999 and finally won its first Berlin Cup title. Ayhan Gezen and Mario Maek scored one goal each, and Heiko Brestrich scored two goals for BFC Dynamo in the final.[315]\\n\\nRelegation to NOFV-Oberliga and crash (1999–2001)\\nBFC Dynamo recruited goalkeeper Nico Thomaschewski for the 1999–2000 season. Thomaschewski became the new first-choice goalkeeper. Torsten Boer, Jens Reckmann and Dirk Rehbein also returned to the club.[316][317] The team was also joined by forward Marcel Riediger from the youth department. Marcel Riediger was the son of former BFC Dynamo striker Hans-Jürgen Riediger.[318][319] The team lost 0–2 to Arminia Bielefeld the first round of the 1999-2000 DFB-Pokal.[320] BFC Dynamo defeated SG Dynamo Dresden 1–0 on the sixth matchday.[316] The team stood at a sensational second place in the league after the eight matchday, but then followed a sharp descline.[321][322] BFC Dynamo suffered a period of crisis during the autumn of 1999.[323] The financial difficulties had continued. The number of sponsors was too few and the club was financially dependent on Club President Volkmar Wanski. The number of spectators also remained low and new sponsors were deterred by hooliganism.[311] The team went through several league matches without a single win. Heiko Brestrich eventually rebelled against coach Klaus Goldbach in early November 1999 and was suspended. He was then sacked and transferred to VfB Leipzig.[324][325][326][327] Brestrich was very popular with the supporters of BFC Dynamo and was popularly called \\\"Heiko Brestrich - Football God\\\" (German: Heiko Brestrich - Fußballgott).[324][328] He had played a total of 301 matches for BFC Dynamo during his career, including 282 matches between 1991 and 1999.[324][329] The team was joined by Russian striker Denis Kozlov later the same month. Kozlov would eventually prove successful at BFC Dynamo. Coach Goldbach was eventually dismissed in early December 1999 and Jürgen Bogs returned for his third stint as coach.[330]\\n\\nThe club finally got a promising main sponsor in the form of the software company Lipro AG at the beginning of 2000.[331][332] However, the difficulties in the league continued and the club\'s liabilities had already started to become significant.[332] BFC Dynamo finished the 1999-2000 Regionalliga Nordost in 17th place and was relegated to the NOFV-Oberliga Nord. For the first time in its history, BFC Dynamo was now a fourth tier team.[333] BFC Dynamo reached the final of the Berlin Cup for a second consecutive season, but lost the final of the 1999-2000 Berlin Cup 2–0 against the reserve team of Tennis Borussia Berlin.[334] Club President Wanski resigned on 29 June 2000.[335][336][337] The reason was allegedly that the sponsor Lipro AG demanded greater influence in club decision making.[335][336] The club was now temporary in the hands of Sports director Hans Reker.[335] Mario Maek retired as a player after the 1999–2000 season and several players left the team, including Thorsten Boer and Martino Gatti.[335][336] A new team was put together for the 2000-01 NOFV-Oberliga Nord. The budget for the season was 2.3 million Deutsche Mark, which set new record for the NOFV-Oberliga Nord.[336] The team was joined by striker Dirk Vollmar, Cameroonian midfielder Aka Adek Mba, Brazilian midfielder Alexandre Vieira dos Santos, nicknamed \\\"Macalé\\\", as well as five Romanian players: Dănuț Oprea, Silvian Cristescu, Aurel Panait, Dorel Zegrean, and Florin Bătrânu.[336][338] SPD-politician Karin Halsch became new club president on 27 September 2000.[339][340][nb 7] BFC Dynamo dominated the 2000-01 NOFV-Oberliga Nord. The team was drawn against arch-rival 1. FC Union Berlin in the quarter-finals of the 2000-01 Berlin Cup The match was played in front of 4,427 spectators at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark on 24 March 2001. BFC Dynamo lost 3–0.[341] Serious riots broke out after the match when BFC Dynamo supporters clashed with the police.[342] The team finished the 2000-01 NOFV-Oberliga in first place, with only three losses in 34 matches.[343] Denis Kozlov had scored a wopping 29 goals for BFC Dynamo in the league.[343] The team would now face 1. FC Magdeburg in a play-off for promotion to the Regionalliga Nord.\\n\\nHowever, it had become apparent that the club had serious financial problems two weeks before the play-offs. Players and coaches had received their January salaries in March and had not received any salaries since. The club was also behind with insurance payments.[344][345][346] The German Football Association (DFB) demanded that the club could provide a bank guarantee of 4.2 million Deutsche Mark to secure the budget for the possible 2001–02 Regionalliga Nord. It was already clear before the first match in the play-offs that the club would have difficulty meeting the requirements of the DFB in the event of promotion.[343][347] The first match of the play-offs ended 0–0 in front of 8,282 spectators at the Stadion im Sportforum on 2 June 2001.[348] The second match was played at the Ernst-Grube-Stadion in Magdeburg on 9 June 2001. Around 2,000 supporters from BFC Dynamo traveled to the second match.[349][350] The score was 2–2 at half time. BFC Dynamo was practically promoted at this point.[348] However, the team ultimately lost the match 2–5.[348][351] The club\'s debts were now estimated at 1.5 million Deutsche Mark.[352] And now, also the main sponsor Lipro AG was in financial trouble.[353][354] Several players left the club directly after the 2000–01 season, including Marcel Riediger and Denis Kozlov.[343][352]\\n\\nInsolvency (2001–2002)\\nInsurance company AOK filed for insolvency against BFC Dynamo on 21 June 2001. The company demanded 126,000 Deutsche Mark in unpaid insurance payments.[355] Club President Karin Halsch resigned on 25 June 2001.[355] There had been major discrepancies between Halsch and sports director Hans Reker regarding how the situation should be resolved.[355] Reker took over as acting president.[356] Supporters of BFC Dynamo started the fundraiser \\\"Save BFC Dynamo\\\" (German: Rettet den BFC). The fundraiser quickly succeeded in raising 40,000 Euros.[357][358][359] More players left the team during the summer of 2001, including Mario Kallnik and Aka Adeck Mba.[360] The debts were estimated at 5 millions Deutsche Mark, of which 4.2 million were loans from Lipro AG and 1.3 short-term debts, at this point.[361] The club tried to initiate a partnership with FC Dynamo Moscow, in which BFC Dynamo would serve as a farm team for FC Dynamo Moscow in Europe.[362] But the plan led nowhere.[363] A preliminary insolvency administrator was appointed at the end of August 2001.[364] It was estimated that insolvency proceedings could be opened on 1 November 2001.[365] Insolvency proceedings were opened against main sponsor Lipro AG on 5 October 2001.[366]\\n\\nThe preliminary insolvency administrator estimated the club\'s debts at 6 million Deutsche Mark.[367] BFC Dynamo needed 30,000 Deutsche Mark by 31 October 2001 in order to commence insolvency proceedings.[368] However, the club did not have the money.[369] Discussions with new sponsors failed.[370] If insolvency proceedings could not be opened, the club would go bankrupt and have to restart in the Kreisliga under a new name.[363][365][371][368] Supporters organized a demonstration that marched from the Sportforum Hohenschönhausen to the Rotes Rathaus. Also former players such as Hans-Jürgen Riediger, Rainer Troppa, Waldemar Ksienzyk and Heiko Brestrich planned to participate. The demonstration was received at the Rotes Rathaus by former club president and SPD-politician Halsch.[369][372][368] A group of sponsors around former president Volkmar Waski finally came forward and offered the money required to commence insolvency proceedings.[373][374] The club\'s entire presidium resigned on 31 October 2001.[375][337] An emergency board formed by André Sommer, Rayk Bernt and press spokesman Holger Zimmermann was appointed by the club\'s Economic Council.[376][370]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo is said to have made millions on player sales after Die Wende.[356][377][378] The club was for a time considered the richest amateur club in Germany.[295] But not all the money had went to the club, some had also went to SV Dynamo, DFV and advisers.[379][380] The club\'s reputation as the former Stasi club made it difficult to win new sponsors.[296][381][356][382] The club was also plagued by hooliganism, which repeatedly caused negative headlines.[382][340] FC Berlin failed to qualify for the 2. Bundesliga and never progressed beyond the third tier of the German football league system.[383] The number of spectators was only a couple of hundred per match in the early 1990s and the income from membership fees was marginal.[382][383] The club also maintained a large youth department which at one point cost about 400,000 Deutsche Mark per year.[382] At the end of 1996, the club still had no debts, but also no money left in its bank accounts.[296] President Wanski would then have to support the club with his own financial contributions.[296] It is estimated that Wanski invested an estimated 3 million Deutsche Mark of private money in the club over the five years before his resignation.[384] BFC Dynamo finally got a promising new sponsor in the form of Lipro AG in early 2000. Millions of Deutsche Mark would now be available.[385] But the club\'s liabilites had already started to become significant.[385] The club made a bid to reach the third tier Regionalliga Nord, and sports director Hans Reker started signing new players.[385] However, the millions from sponsor Lipro AG would later turn out to be loans.[385]\\n\\nThe emergency board was considered to represent the interest of the sponsor group around Wanski.[386] André Sommer and Rayk Bernt were controversial due to their membership in the Hells Angels.[387] However, both were also long-time supporters; Sommer had been a member of the hooligan scene back in the 1980s.[388][389] Zimmermann resigned from the emergency board on 23 November 2001, as he thought Sommer and Berndt had given the club an image he could not identify with.[390] A new presidium was due to be elected at a general meeting on 26 November 2001.[337] But the general meeting was converted into an \\\"information event\\\" by a vote of 87 to 59, at the insistence of the emergency board.[390][391] Some club members felt they had been blackmailed.[391] Sommer and Bernt continued to lead the club during the opening of the insolvency proceedings, but the legitimacy of their presidium was questioned.[390]\\n\\nInsolvency proceedings were opened on 1 November 2001.[392][393][394] BFC Dynamo was thus automatically relegated to the Verbandsliga Berlin.[372] All contracts with professionals and employees were terminated.[372][395][396][393] The club now had to continue under amateur conditions, the players could only be offered 300 Euros per month.[369][337] Only three players from the original squad remained for the first mandatory friendly match, one of them was team captain Piotr Rowicki.[397][337] Jörn Lenz left for VfB Leipzig and Nico Thomaschewski for SV Babelsberg 03.[337] Coach Jürgen Bogs also decided not to continue.[374][398] Former assistant coach Mario Maek stepped in as the new coach on a voluntary basis, assisted by goalkeeping coach Bodo Rudwaleit.[398] The club once again had to rely on its youth players.[399]\\n\\nSommer and Bernt met great opposition due to their membership in the Hells Angels.[400] The duo had a deterrent effect and failed to attract new sponsors.[388][401] Supporters collected signatures to elect a new presidium.[388][402] But the signatures were ignored by Sommer and Berndt.[388][402] The former coach of the women\'s team Volkmar Lucius then took legal action for violation of the statutes.[388][402] The Sommer and Bernt presidium was then finally overthrown by supporters and Lucius, through a successful application to the Charlottenburg District Court.[388][402][401] The court appointed Lucius as an emergency board member on 30 April 2002.[388][403] Sommer and Bernt had, after all, helped make sure that the insolvency proceedings could be opened by their personal financial contributions.[402][404] But the duo would no longer have much say in the club after 2003.[405] The interest group IG BFC\'er managed to persuade entrepreneur Mike Peters to become the new club president.[401][404] Peters was elected as the new president on 31 May 2002.[406] The preferential claims of 204,000 Euros looked insurmountable.[401] But the supporters had negotiated with creditors and received numerous waivers.[401][407] They had also set up a donations account and collected at least 13,800 Euros themselves.[407][406] The new presidum around Peters would also contribute 100,000 Euros from private money to the insolvency plan.[406][401][407] Peters also committed to funding a large part of the budget for the 2002-03 Verbandsliga Berlin.[406][408]\\n\\nRestart in Verbandsliga Berlin and end of insolvency (2002–2004)\\nFormer BFC Dynamo player Dirk Vollmar became the new coach for the 2002–03 season.[406] Bodo Rudwaleit continued as assistant coach.[406] Nico Thomaschewski and Aka Adeck Mba returned for the 2002–03 season.[409][410] The team was also joined by defender Robert Rudwaleit from the reserve team.[411][408][412] Robert Rudwaleit was the son of Bodo Rudwaleit and had made his first few appearances with the first team during the previous season.[413] BFC Dynamo defeated the reserve team of 1. FC Union Berlin in both meetings in 2002-03 Verbandsliga Berlin.[414] The team eventuallty finished its first season in the Verbandsliga Berlin in third place.[414] The insolvency situation was complex. The club had about 170 creditors. It was still unclear whether the insolvency proceedings could be successful.[415]\\n\\nJörn Lenz returned to the club for the 2003–04 season.[416] BFC Dynamo also recruited striker Danny Kukulies from SC Pfullendorf for the season. Kukulies had a long background in the youth department of BFC Dynamo.[417] BFC Dynamo was in third place after the first half of the season, nine points behind BFC Preussen and six points behind second placed SV Tasmania Gropiusstadt 73.[418] The team defeated SV Tasmania Gropiusstadt 73 2–1 in the first league match after the winter break, with one goal by Lenz and one goal by Robert Rudwaleit.[419] The team would also win the following matches.[420] BFC Dynamo eventually finished the 2003-04 Verbandsliga Berlin in first place and won promotion back to the NOFV-Oberliga Nord. The team had won all 17 matches in the second half of the league season, which set new record in the Verbandsliga Berlin.[421] Danny Kukulies scored 32 goals and Tomasz Suwary 22 goals in the 2003-04 Verbandsliga Berlin.[422] The insolvency proceedings would finally come to a positive conclusion after a meeting with the creditors at the Charlottenburg District Court on 8 June 8, 2004. The 192 creditors received an insolvency rate of 0.25 percent.[423][422] The insolvency proceedings were then finally declared closed by the Charlottenburg District Court on 16 June 2004, after one complaint was dismissed.[424]\\n\\nConsolidation, Regionalliga Nordost and Berlin Cup success (2004-present)\\nMain article: History of Berliner FC Dynamo (2004–present)\\nConsolidation (2004-2010)\\nMario Weinkauf was elected as new club president at the annual meeting on 18 June 2004. His vision for BFC Dynamo was a club that was \\\"managed seriously from a sporting and financial perspective\\\".[425][426] Former professional player Christian Backs became the new coach for the 2004–05 season.[427] Central players in the team in the 2004–05 season were Robert Rudwaleit, Nico Thomaschewski, Dennis Kutrieb, Jörn Lenz, Danny Kukulies and Tomasz Suwary.[428][429] There were several outbreaks of riots and hooliganism among the supporters of BFC Dynamo during the season.[430][431] The club management decided not to apply for a license to the Regionalliga Nordost despite the team being in third place in the league at the start of the second half of the season.

BFC Dynamo was debt-free ahead of the 2005–06 season.[435] BFC Dynamo negotiated a lucrative sponsorship agreement with the energy company United Sol Energy. The company\'s representative in Berlin was the Belgian former FC Bayern Munich goalkeeper Jean-Marie Pfaff.[436][435][437] The plan also included the founding of a new youth sports school at BFC Dynamo that would bear Pfaff\'s name.[437] New riots broke out among supporters in connection with the match against SV Yeşilyurt on first matchday of the 2005-06 NOFV-Oberliga Nord on 5 August 2005. As many as 13 police officers were injured in the riots.[438][439] The 2005-05 NOFV-Oberliga Nord involved new derbies against 1. FC Union Berlin.

Coach Piepenberg was dismissed after the match.[442]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo came to play with the logo of United Sol Energy on their shirts at the beginning of the season, despite the fact that the club had yet to receive any money.[443][444] It eventually became clear that there would be no money from United Sol Energy.[445][446] Club spokesman Yiannis Kaufmann resigned from all posts in September 2005 due to disagreements over the club\'s policy regarding sponsors.

The anniversary was celebrated with a party for supporters with 750 guests.[452] The club management worked to ensure that the club would no longer be associated with hooligans and the far-right scene. The Israeli fashion brand JetLag became a new sponsor at the turn of the year and Weinkauf also planned a training camp in Israel.[453] The club decided not to extend the sponsorship agreements with several controversial sponsors at the beginning of 2006. The index included companies with links to Hells Angels.[453] The return match against 1.

Membership of the club increased by 51 percent in 2021.[608] The team was joined by experience defender Sebastian Hertner during the winter break.[609][610] BFC Dynamo defeated Chemnitzer FC 1–3 away on the 31st matchday.[611] The team was now ten points ahead of second-placed VSG Altglienicke, as well as 11 points ahead of third-placed 1. FC Lokomotiv Lepzig and fourth-placed FC Carl Zeiss Jena. Afterwards, however, declining results followed. BFC Dynamo were six points behind second-placed FC Carl Zeiss Jena with two matchdays remaining, but the team had the best goal difference in the league by far.[612] FC Carl Zeiss Jena only had a theoretical chance to push BFC Dynamo off the top.[613] BFC Dynamo eventually finished the 2021-22 Regionaliga Nordost in first place and had finally captured its first ever Regionalliga title.[614] Christian Beck became the league top goalscorer with 23 goals.[615] The team faced VfB Oldenburg from Regionalliga Nord in the play-off for the 3.

Liga, the German Football Association (DFB) demanded that the club provide a massive guarantee of 900,000 Euros, as a security for the budget in the 3. Liga.[616] BFC Dynamo started a fundraiser to collect the amount. With the help of sponsors, supporters and Economic Council, the club managed to collect the amount.[617][618][619] BFC Dynamo lost the first play-off match 0–2 in front of 4,420 spectators at Sadion im Sportforum on 28 May 2022.[620] The second match was played at Marschweg-Stadion in Oldenburg on 4 June 2022.

The match ended 2–1 to BFC Dynamo, but VfB Oldenburg won the play-off on goal difference.[621][622] BFC Dynamo parted ways with coach Benbenneck after the season. The reason given was the stagnation at the end of the league season.[623] New coach for the 2022–23 season was Heiner Backhaus.[624]\\n\\nColours and crest\\nThe colours of BFC Dynamo are claret and white.[625] The colours were inherited from SC Dynamo Berlin and followed the claret colour scheme of SV Dynamo. BFC Dynamo has been playing in claret and white since the club\'s founding, with the exception of a period in the 1990s. The BFC Dynamo home kit has traditionally been a claret shirt, paired with claret or white shorts and socks. The team is occasionally nicknamed \\\"die Weinroten\\\", which means \\\"the Clarets\\\".[626][627]\\n\\nThe BFC Dynamo away kit has traditionally been a white shirt, paired with claret or white shorts and socks. However, the team used green away shirts from the end of the 1960s until the mid-1970s.[628][83] Green was the colour of the Volkspolizei, which was the official sponsor of BFC Dynamo during the East German era. The green away shirt was then exchanged for a white away shirt, paired with red or white shorts and socks.[93][99] The team used entirely red away kits during the 1981–82 and 1982–83 seasons.[629][630] The red away kit was then exchanged for a claret away kit.[631] The team again used white away shirts from the 1985–86 season.[632] The 1985–86 season also saw the instruction of a new claret and white diagonally striped away shirt.[632] The diagonally striped away shirt would be used for the rest of the 1980s.[237]\\n\\nThe club was rebranded as FC Berlin on 19 February 1990. A pure white was set as the new match colour with immediate effect.[633] FC Berlin then adopted a red and white colour scheme for the 1990–91 season.[634] In the eyes of the supporters, the red and white kit looked a lot like 1. FC Union Berlin.[634] The club played in red and white home kits for most of the FC Berlin era, but wore a black and red striped home shirt, paired with black shorts and socks from the 1996–97 season through the 1998–99 season. The club returned to its original club name on 3 May 1999 and consequently also later returned to its traditional colour scheme.[635]\\n\\n1966-1990, 1999–2009, 2023-\\n1966-1990, 1999–2009, 2023-\\n\\n \\n2009-2023\\n2009-2023\\n\\nThe crest of BFC Dynamo during the East German era featured a stylized \\\"D\\\" for SV Dynamo and the lettering \\\"BFC\\\" in red and yellow on a white background, surrounded by a yellow wreath.[636][637] BFC Dynamo abandoned its East German crest when the club was rebranded as FC Berlin on 19 February 1990.[638][639][636] The club used two different crests during the FC Berlin era. The first crest featured a stylized image of the roof of the Brandenburg Gate with the lettering \\\"FCB\\\" underneath and the club name \\\"Fussballclub Berlin\\\" in capital letters at the bottom, in white on a red background. It was only briefly used during the spring of 1990.[640] The second crest featured a stylized image of a football with the Brandenburg Gate in front, the lettering \\\"FCB\\\" at the top and the club name \\\"FC Berlin\\\" at the bottom, in red on a white background. This crest was used from the spring of 1990 until the end of the FC Berlin era.[640][284]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo reclaimed its East German crest when the club returned to its original club name on 3 May 1999.[639] But the club was no longer in possession of the crest.[639] The club had neglected to seek legal protection for its East German crest after German reunification. The neglect was likely due to managerial inexperience. Protection of trademarks was neither necessary nor common in East Germany.[636] The crest was now owned by Peter Klaus-Dieter Mager, commonly known as \\\"Pepe\\\". Pepe Mager was a famous fan of Hertha BSC and a fan merchandise dealer.[641] The club tried to recover the crest from Mager though court action, without success.[639][636] The ownership of the crest was instead passed on to Rayk Bernt and his company RA-BE Immobilien- und Handelsgesellschaft mbH.[479][642][643]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo continued to use the disputed crest on its kits and webpage. But the club would have to ask the owner of the crest every time it wanted to have a pennant made and was unable to exploit the commercial value of the crest for its own benefit.[479][516] The legal situation around the crest would also have caused problems in the event of an advance to the Regionalliga, as the German football Association (DFB) required clubs to own their crests.[517] In order establish independence, the club finally decided to adopt a new crest in 2009.[467]\\n\\nThe new crest abandoned the traditional stylized \\\"D\\\" and the lettering \\\"BFC\\\", as they would have met legal obstacles.[643] The new crest featured a black Berlin bear on claret and white stripes, together with the club name and the founding year.[643] The first version of the new crest sparked controversy. The word \\\"fußball\\\" in the club name had been written in lower case with a double \\\"s\\\" instead of the graphene \\\"ß\\\".[643] This was contrary to German spelling rules, where it is only permissible to write \\\"fußball\\\" with a double \\\"s\\\" when the word is written in upper case. Club President Norbert Uhlig ensured that there was absolutely no ulterior motive behind the spelling and claimed that the word had always been spelled like that on club pennants and scarfs.[643] The Chairman of the Economic Council Peter Meyer later claimed that the spelling was a deliberate marketing ploy, in order to have new crest immediately known across Germany.[643] A second version of the crest was soon made public, where the club name was written in upper case. The new crest was used by BFC Dynamo from the 2009–10 season.[516]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo finally managed win back the traditional crest in 2022, through the Chairman of the Economic Council Peter Meyer. Meyer had acquired the rights to the crest through one of his companies.[644] From the 2023–24 season, BFC Dynamo is once again playing with its traditional crest. The traditional crest was displayed for the first time since its reintroduction in a friendly match against Hertha BSC in front of more than 10,000 spectators at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark on 7 July 2023.[645][646]\\n\\nOwnership of the traditional crest\\nMany clubs in East Germany rushed to drop their East German names during the Peaceful revolution. BFC Dynamo was among the clubs to do so, in an attempt to distance the club from the Stasi.[639][250] The club was rebranded as FC Berlin on 19 February 1990 and consequently abandoned its East German crest.\\n\\nPepe Mager was a famous fan of Hertha BSC and fan merchandise dealer.[641] Mager had organized away trips for the fans Hertha in the early 1960s and was one of the founders of the notorious supporter group \\\"Hertha-Frösche\\\". He now sold his own fan merchandise from a mobile stand outside the Olympiastadion.[641][647][648] Mager inquired with the register of associations in Charlottenburg in 1991 about all deleted names of East German clubs.[641] He immediately found BFC Dynamo and saw business opportunities.[641][639] Mager claimed that he first secured the former crest of BFC Dynamo for 80 D-Marks in 1992.[381][643]\\n\\nThe name FC Berlin never became popular with the fans.[250] Fans continued to identify themselves with the former name and crest.[639] An overwhelming majority voted for the club to take back its original club name at the general meeting on 3 May 1999.[635] Of the 135 present, 125 voted in favor, three against and seven abstained.[309] BFC Dynamo thus reclaimed its East German crest, but the rights to the crest now belonged to Mager.[639] Mager had registered the crest in his name at the German Patent and Trademark Office on 13 May 1997.[639][649][636]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo contacted Mager for a co-operation, but an agreement could not be reached.[641][649] Mager held the opinion that the club should buy its merchandise from him, or simply buy the rights to the crest.[639] He later informed the club that he had received interest from foreign buyers and offered the club to buy the rights.[649] He claimed that the crest was worth 200,000 D-Marks.[639] BFC Dynamo on the other hand claimed that the crest should legally belong to the club. The club sued Mager in court on 20 November 2000, but eventually lost the case.[639][636] The club decided to suspend the legal dispute with Mager in the summer of 2001 and instead wanted to find a solution outside court.[650] Mager was repeatedly exposed to minor threats from the environment around BFC Dynamo and eventually sold the crest to Rayk Bernt and his company RA-BE Immobilien- und Handelsgesellschaft mbH for a price of 50,000 D-Marks in June 2002.[479][642][517][651]\\n\\nBernt was a close associate of André Sommer.[652] Bernt and Sommer had assisted the club at the opening of the insolvency proceedings in 2001–2002.[652][453][479] Both were long time fans of BFC Dynamo.[653][479][642] But the duo was controversial for their connections to Hells Angels.[653][652] Bernt and Sommer were almost as restrictive towards the club when it came to the crest as Mager had been. Bernt organized the production of fan merchandise in his own regime.[642] The club would have to ask his company every time it wanted to have a pennant made.[479] Bernt and Sommer usually agreed, manufactured the pennant and then sold it at their own fan merchandise stand at the stadium.[479] BFC Dynamo continued to use the crest and would at times be given ten percent of the revenues from their sales.[453][479][642][643] The club eventually offered 5,000 Euros for the crest, but was turned down.[453] Sponsor Peter Meyer was also said to have offered 150,000 euros for the buyback.[478] Bernt demanded a seven-digit sum, according to former Club President Mario Weinkauf.[453] The lawyer representing RA-BE Immobilien- und Handelsgesellschaft mbH allegedly claimed the crest was worth around 600,000 Euros at the time.[654]\\n\\nPresident Weinkauf planned to recover the rights to the former crest with the help of Thomas Thiel and the company Treasure AG before the general meeting on 23 June 2007. Thiel was a co-owner of Treasure AG, which was intended as a new major sponsor.[479] Bernt sold parts of the rights to the former crest to Thiel.[655] The price was allegedly a six-digit sum.[479][643] According to the plan, the club would be given the rights of use to the crest. The profits would thus go to the club. The club would pay a symbolic sum of 1 Euro per month for the rights of use. BFC Dynamo would then have a right of first refusal after the ten-year contract had expired and thus have the opportunity to eventually acquire ownership of the crest.[479][656] However, Weinkauf was ultimately rejected by club members in a vote of no-confidence at the general meeting on 23 June 2007.[485] Weinkauf would then be contacted by the former president of Tennis Borussia Berlin Peter Antony. Treasure AG became a sponsor of Tennis Borussia Berlin instead and Weinkauf would later become president of the club.[480]\\n\\nThiel sold his rights to the crest back to Bernt and his company BFC Dynamo Vermarktungsgesellschaft m.b.H in 2009.[657] The rights to the old crest where subsequently controlled again by the company RA-BE Immobilien- und Handelsgesellschaft mbH.[658][659] The company is controlled by Bernt, who sold occasional items with the former crest at his own webpage.[638] However, RA-BE Immobilien- und Handelsgesellschaft mbH transferred its rights to company AXXON AG in 2022.[660][661] In connection with the club\'s 57th anniversary in 2023, the Chairman of the Economic Council Peter Meyer revealed in an exclusive interview with Berliner Kurier that he had acquired the rights to the crest for the club through one of his companies. After more than 13 years, the traditional crest was finally back with the club. According to Berliner Kurier and Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk (MDR), a six-digit sum is said to have become due.[644][662]\\n\\nChampionship star\\nThe German Football League (DFL) introduced a system of championship stars in the 2004–05 season. The system was meant to honor the most successful teams in the Bundesliga by allowing teams to display stars on their shirts for the championships they have won. The system awarded one star for three titles, two stars for five titles, and three stars for ten titles.[663] However, the system only counted titles won in the Bundesliga since the 1963–64 season.[664][665][666]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo submitted an application to the DFL and the DFB on 9 August 2004 to receive three stars for its ten titles in the DDR-Oberliga. The club asked for equal rights and argued that the German Football Association (DFB) had absorbed the German Football Association of the GDR (DFV) with all its statistics, international matches and goal scorers.[663][667][668][664] BFC Dynamo received support from Dynamo Dresden and 1. FC Magdeburg in its attempts to achieve recognition for East German titles.[667][664]\\n\\nThe DFL responded that it was not the responsible body, but the DFB remained silent for a long time.[665] The DFB eventually declared itself responsible and recommended BFC Dynamo to submit a formal application for a new title symbol in accordance with a relevant paragraph.[664][665] BFC Dynamo commissioned a law firm in Mitte in January 2005 and sent a new letter to the DFB. The DFB announced that the application from BFC Dynamo was going to be negotiated in a meeting with the DFB presidium.[665] The meeting with the DFB presidium on 18 March 2005 agreed that all titles won in East Germany, as well all others titles won in Germany since the first recognized championship in 1903, should qualify for stars.[669] However, the decision was subject to approval by the DFL.[670] No final decision had yet been made by the DFB presidium.[671][672][673][674]\\n\\n\\nBFC Dynamo is allowed to wear one star inscribed with the number ten for its ten East German championships.\\nHowever, BFC Dynamo took matters in its own hands and unilaterally emblazoned its shirts with three stars.[672] The team displayed the three stars for first time in the match against FC Energie Cottbus II on 25 March 2005.[672] The claim by BFC Dynamo was controversial because the club had been the favorite club of Erich Mielke and had had a connection to the Stasi during the East German era.[672][673][675][676][666] Critics in the DFB environment pointed to politically influenced championships in East Germany. BFC Dynamo had been sponsored by the Stasi and had enjoyed advantages.[665] The club had privileged access to talents and a permanent training camp at Uckley in Königs Wusterhausen. However, also other clubs in East Germany had enjoyed similar advantages, which put the DFB in a difficult situation.[665] Also former East German referee and CDU parliamentarian Bernd Heynemann spoke out for recognition of all East German titles.[666]\\n\\nThe DFL rejected the application from the DFB and recommended the DFB to only honor clubs that were champions in the Bundesliga.[677] However, the DFB chose to not follow the recommendation. The DFB presidium instead decided on a compromise solution on 19 July 2005 and adopted a new regulation for the 2005–06 season which gave all clubs the right to wear one single star for the championships they have won in the former East Germany and in Germany since 1903. Clubs were also allowed to indicate the number of championships they have won in the center of the star.[678][679][680] The regulation only applies to clubs playing in a league under the DFB umbrella. It does not apply to clubs playing in the 2. Bundesliga and Bundesliga, which are organized by the DFL.[679]\\n\\nThe new regulation meant that BFC Dynamo was finally allowed to emblazon its shirts with a championship star. The regulation also affected other former East German teams including Dynamo Dresden with its eight titles, 1. FC Frankfurt with its six titles and Magdeburg with its three titles in the Oberliga.[665][680] BFC Dynamo has since then used the championship star in accordance with DFB graphic standards, displaying a star inscribed with the number ten for its ten East German titles.[681]\\n\\nStadiums\\nMain article: Stadion im Sportforum\\nThe long-time home and training facility of BFC Dynamo is the Sportforum Hohenschönhausen in Alt-Hohenschönhausen in Berlin. The sports complex is the location of the club offices and the clubhouse.[637] It is also the base of the youth teams.[637] More than 20 youth teams of BFC Dynamo regularly train at the facilities.[682] The Sportforum Hohenschönhausen is considered the spiritual home of the club.[637]\\n\\nThe Sportforum Hohenschönhausen was known as the Dynamo-Sportforum during the East German era.[683] The sports complex was built as a training center for elite sport and was home to sports club SC Dynamo Berlin, with its many departments and squads.[684][685] Development began in 1954 and expansion continued into the 1980s.[686] The Sportforum is still unique as of today.[687] The sports complex covers an area of 45 to 50 hectares and comprises 35 sports facilities as of 2020.[684][687][688][689]\\n\\n\\nA match between SC Dynamo Berlin and SC Turbine Erfurt at the Walter-Ulbricht-Stadion in 1959.\\nSC Dynamo Berlin played its first season at the large Walter-Ulbricht-Stadion in Mitte.[17][690] The team moved its home matches to the football stadium in the Dynamo-Sportforum for the short transitional 1955 season.[691] SC Dynamo Berlin returned to the Walter-Ulbricht-Stadion for the 1956 season.[690] The team would play at the Walter-Ublricht-Stadion for the rest of the 1950s.[690]\\n\\nSC Dynamo Berlin eventually moved its home matches permanentely to the Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum after the construction of the Berlin wall began on 13 August 1961.[17][692] The football stadium in the Dynamo-Sportforum held a capacity of 10,000 spectators at the beginning of the 1961–62 season.[683][nb 8] The team drew average attendances between 3,000 and 6,000 spectators in the DDR-Oberliga at the Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum in the 1960s.[704][705] The highlights were matches against local rival ASK Vorwärts Berlin and the various top teams during the period. The capacity of the football stadium in the Dynamo-Sportforum was gradually expanded during the 1960s.[692][nb 9]\\n\\n\\nA match between BFC Dynamo and BSG Chemie Leipzig at the Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum in 1966.\\nBFC Dynamo began playing occasional matches that required floodlights at the larger Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark in Prenzlauer Berg from November 1968.[692] The Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark was the home ground of FC Vorwärts Berlin at the time. However, the stadium became vacant when FC Vorwärts Berlin was relocated to Frankfurt an der Oder on 31 July 1971.[63] BFC Dynamo played its home matches in the 1971-72 European Cup Winners\' Cup at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark.[708] The matches against Åtvidabergs FF in the quarter-finals on 22 March 1972 and FC Dynamo Moscow in the semi-finals on 5 April 1972 were each attended by 30,000 spectators.[709][710] The team also played two home matches in the 1971-72 DDR-Oberliga at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark.[711] However, more matches at the stadium were not possible after the summer of 1972, as the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark was then undergoing extensive renovation for the upcoming 10th World Festival of Youth and Students.[690]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo was qualified for the 1972-73 UEFA Cup. However, neither the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark nor the Walter-Ulbricht-Stadion were available for the upcoming UEFA Cup matches. Both were undergoing extensive renovation for the 10th World Festival of Youth and Students. Instead, the Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum underwent a complete transformation in just five weeks between the end of July 1972 and September 1972.[690] The capacity of the Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum was now expanded to 20,000 spectators.[712][713][692] BFC Dynamo played all home matches in the 1972-73 UEFA Cup at the Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum. The attendance of 20,000 spectators during the match against Liverpool on 29 November 1972 is still a record attendance for the stadium.[696] BFC Dynamo remained at the Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum for a couple more seasons. The team saw rising attendance numbers at the Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum during the 1970s.[714] An average of 12,000 people attended the last six matches of BFC Dynamo at the Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum in the second half of the 1973–74 season.[692] The match between BFC Dynamo and 1. FC Magdeburg in the 1974-75 DDR-Oberliga at the Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum on 8 March 1975 was attended by a whole 19,000 spectators.[715]\\n\\n\\nA match between BFC Dynamo and SG Dynamo Dresden in front of 25,000 spectators at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark in 1976.[716]\\nBFC Dynamo eventually moved its home matches to the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark for the 1975–76 season, due to upcoming repair work at the Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum.[692] The move was meant to be temporary, but eventually became permanent.[692] The Dynamo-Sportforum would primarily serve as a training facility from then and the football stadium would be used mostly by the reserve team BFC Dynamo II. The Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark held a capacity of 30,00 spectators in the 1975–76 season.[708] The average home attendance of 16,538 spectators for BFC Dynamo at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Stadion in the 1975-76 DDR-Oberliga is the highest average league attendance in club history.[17][717] BFC Dynamo celebrated nine of its ten DDR-Oberliga titles in the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Stadium. The team also played most of its home matches in the UEFA competitions at the stadium. BFC Dynamo hosted teams such as Shakhtar Donetsk, Red Star Belgrade, Nottingham Forest, Hamburger SV, Aston Villa, AS Roma FC Aberdeen at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Stadium in the 1970s and 1980. However, all matches in the derby against 1. FC Union Berlin were played at the neutral Stadion der Weltjugend from the 1976–77 season for security reasons.[294][718][719][720]\\n\\nA permanent training camp for BFC Dynamo was built in Uckley in the Zernsdorf district of Königs Wusterhausen in Bezirk Potsdam at the end of the 1960s.[721] It was located in the woods and completely sealed off from the surroundings.[721][722] The training camp covered an area of around 10 hectares.[722] The complex was equipped with a boarding school, several football pitches, a sports hall, a swimming pool, a fitness area and a sauna.[723][724][725][722][726] The team would gather in Uckley days before its European matches.[17] The players would have access to catering facilities, a nearby lake, a bowling alley, a cinema and pinball machines, among other things.[725][726]\\n\\n\\nThe team of BFC Dynamo in front of the new grandstand of the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark in 1987.\\nBFC Dynamo moved its home matches temporary to the Dynamo-Sportforum for the 1986–87 season, as the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark was undrgoing redevelopment during the season for the upcoming 750th anniversary of Berlin.[692][708] The team also played its home matches in the 1986-87 European Cup at the Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum. The team then returned to the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark for the 1987–88 season.[727] The Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark now had a new four storey grandstand and new floodlight masts. The current grandstand and the floodlights of the stadium dates from this time.[696] The club was rebranded as FC Berlin after Die Wende. FC Berlin moved permanently to the Stadion im Sportforum at the beginning of the 1992–93 season.[696] The team would remain in the Sportforum Hohenschönhausen for many seasons to come.[692]\\n\\nThe capacity of the Stadion im Sportforum had been reduced to about 12,000 spectators by 1992.[692] FC Berlin only drew an average of a couple of hundred spectators per match at the Stadion im Sportforum in the mid-1990s. The highlights were the matches against 1. FC Union Berlin. FC Berlin under Club President Volkmar Wanski announced plans in April 1998 to buy and modernize the stadium.[300] However, the plans eventually failed due to lack of funds. The team saw rising attendance numbers at the Stadion im Sportforum at the end of the 1990s.[714] Active supporters of BFC Dynamo were traditionally found at the northern curved end, popularly known as the Nordwall stand.[717] 4,220 spectators watched the match between BFC Dynamo and Union Berlin at the Stadion im Sportforum on 23 November 1999.[728]\\n\\nSupporters of BFC Dynamo installed new bucket seats on the main stand and built a new clubhouse next to the main stand of the Stadion im Sportforum in 2002–2003.[729] The Stadion im Sportforum was then equipped with a 25-metre player tunnel and plexiglass-clad coaching benches in November 2004.[730] BFC Dynamo made new plans for a modern football stadium in the Sportforum Hohenschönhausen in 2006 under Club President Mario Weinkauf. The club now wanted to build a new modern stadium for 10,000–15,000 spectators.[731] However, these plans did not materialize either. The Stadion im Sportforum was closed at the end of the 2005–06 season following the riots during the match between BFC Dynamo and Union Berlin on 13 May 2006.[457] BFC Dynamo temporarily had to move to the Friedrich-Ludwg-Jahn-Sportpark.[461] The stadium was then refurbished in 2006–2007 to increase safety and meet the requirements of the NOFV.[487] The refurbishment included a new fence.[732]\\n\\n\\nA match between BFC Dynamo and SV Babelsberg 03 on 23 April 2017.\\nBFC Dynamo won promotion to the Regionalliga Nordost at the end of the 2013–14 season. The team moved permanently to the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark for the 2014–15 season, due to increased media and spectator interest following its promotion.[696][733] The 2014-15 Regionalliga Nordost meant matches against well-known opponents such as 1. FC Magdeburg and FC Carl Zeiss Jena. The more central location of the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark was seen by the club as an opportunity to attract more spectators.[733] The match between BFC Dynamo and 1. FC Magdeburg on 8 November 2014 was attended by 5,103 spectators.[734] Active supporters of BFC Dynamo have traditionally been found on the main stand, and on the side opposite the main stand (German: die Gegengerade) of the Friedrich Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark.[717] The match between BFC Dynamo and FC Schalke 04 in the first round of the 2018-19 DFB-Pokal at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark on 17 August 2017 was watched by 14,117 spectators.[570] The attendance was the highest attendance for BFC Dynamo since the fall of the Berlin wall.[570][86] The average league attendance of BFC Dynamo in the 2017-18 Regionalliga Nordost would also be the highest average league attendance of BFC Dynamo since the 1990-91 season.[705]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo had to play a number of matches at the Stadion im Sportforum at the end of the 2018–19 season due to safety issues relating to the dilapidated floodlights at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark.[735] The move was greeted by some supporters as a move to the true home of the club.[736] The club was then set to return to the Sportforum in the 2020–21 season as the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark was planned to be demolished for a complete redevelopment.[637] The team was allowed to continue play in the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark until 31 December 2020.[737] BFC Dynamo then officially announced on 21 March 2021 that the club was going to move back to the Sportforum Hohenschönhausen for the next season.[738]\\n\\nThe Stadion im Sportforum was equipped with a floodlight system in April 2021.[739][740] The club organized a work effort in the summer of 2021 to get the stadium in shape for the upcoming Regionalliga season. [741] Supporters of BFC Dynamo gathered and cleared sections of the old stadium from weeds.[742] Members of the interest group IG BFC\'er also restored the iconic manual scoreboard above the curved end towards the Weißenseer Weg in time for the first home match of the 2021–22 season against Energie Cottbus on 28 July 2021.[743] The attendance for BFC Dynamo at the Stadion im Sportforum in the 2021-22 Regionalliga Nordost was almost tripled compared to the last comparable league season before the COVID-19 pandemic. 3,219 people watched the match between BFC Dynamo and FC Carl Zeiss Jena on 10 April 2022.[744]\\n\\nFuture stadium\\nThe large stadium in the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark is planned to be demolished towards the end of 2023 for a complete redevelopment.[745] The new stadium im the Fredrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark is designed as an inclusive sports facility. The stadium will hold 20,000 spectators and meet the requirements for play in the 3. Liga and 2. Bundesliga.[746][747][745] BFC Dynamo will be able to play matches at the new stadium. The new stadium in the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark is planned to be opened in 2028.[748]\\n\\nSupporters\\nEast German era\\nBFC Dynamo played only a minor role in football in Berlin until the relocation of FC Vorwärts Berlin to Frankfurt an der Oder in 1971.[717] The club initially had modest support, but with its growing successes in the 1970s, the club began to attract young fans, primarily from the central areas around the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark, such as Prenzlauer Berg and Mitte.[174] Many came from working class families in Prenzlauer Berg.[749] One of the first big supporter groups of BFC Dynamo was Black Eagle. The fan club was founded in 1972 and was one of the earliest fan clubs in East German football. Fans of BFC Dynamo were the first to sew their embroidered fan club badges on their jackets. This was a novelty among football supporters in East Germany in the 1970s.[750]\\n\\nThe supporter scene became a focal point for various subcultures in the late 1970s and beginning of the 1980s.[751][520][752] There were punks, rockers, hippies and a few early skinheads.[751][717][753][754][137] Some were left-leaning and others were right-leaning.[751][754] Football and stadium life offered free spaces that were difficult for the authorities to control.[137] For some fans, being part of the supporter scene was an opportunity to rebel against the East German regime.[751] Most supporters of BFC Dynamo had little to do with the state. It was more important for them to protest, do their own thing and break out from everyday life.[717] Despite cheering for a club associated with the Stasi, supporters of BFC Dynamo were not loyal to the line.[751] Many active fans of BFC Dynamo in the 1980s were against the regime.[177][754] Some supporters would even cut out the \\\"D\\\" for SV Dynamo from their club patches. They considered the \\\"BFC\\\" to be free from the Stasi, while they thought the \\\"D\\\" symbolized the exact opposite.[755]\\n\\n\\\"We provoked with chants and slogans. We were right, left, punk, hippie, skinhead. We were direct and provocative, kind and evil, in love, or drunk. Cool words were always well received. Right or left, I don\'t want to classify one. We were all in our fan group against the GDR, rebellion!\\\"\\n\\n– A fan of BFC Dynamo in the 1980s[756]\\nYoung people were gradually attracted by the provocative image of the club: its successes, its reputation as a Stasi club and the hatred of opposing fans.[520][752] Some fans of BFC Dynamo found delight in the unpopularity of their club and took pride in the hatred they met.[754][757][32] One fan recalled that the 1980s \\\"were my greatest years, as we always had glorious success in provoking other fans\\\" and another one that \\\"we were really hated by everyone\\\".[757] Fans of BFC Dynamo would sometimes respond to the hatred they met by singing chants in praise of Erich Mielke as a provocation.[758] They would also throw tropical fruits, that were only available in East Berlin, at home fans during away matches in Saxony.[178][753]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo came to be associated with areas such as Prenzlauer Berg, Pankow, Weißensee, Hohenschönhausen and certain cafés and restaurants in vicinity of Alexanderplatz.[759][760] The supporter scene included groups such as Black Eagle, Norbert Trieloff, Bobbys, Iron Fist, Beatles BFC Club, Die Ratten, Berliner Wölfe, Heavy Horses, Black Pahnter and Madness boys of Preussen in the 1980s.[761] Fashion played a big role in the BFC Dynamo supporter scene.[32][754] Football supporters in East Berlin shared a sense of superiority over their counterparts in the regional districts.[760][751] This was also the case with the supporters of Union Berlin, but notably with the supporters of BFC Dynamo.[760][762][177][763]\\n\\nFootball-related violence spread in East Germany in the 1970s.[137][764] The supporter scene of BFC Dynamo was still young at the time, while clubs such Union Berlin and BSG Chemie Leipzig had large followings.[32] A trip to Leipzig or Dresden was a difficult task.[717] Supporters of BFC Dynamo responded to the hostile environment, and learned to compensate their smaller numbers, by being more aggressive and better organized.[765][174][32][766] The dislike against BFC Dynamo in stadiums around the country and the hatred of opposing fans welded its supporters together.[767] One fan of BFC Dynamo said: \\\"This feeling of being hated is what makes it so appealing.\\\" A saying among the supporters of BFC Dynamo was: \\\"We are few, but we are awesome!\\\" (German: Wir sind wenig, wir sind geil!)[768][32] One fan of BFC Dynamo recalled: \\\"It was really rumbling at away trips, and only then you felt your own strength. When we went with 200 people against 1,000 Unioners and you noticed: If you stick together, you have an incredible amount of violence.\\\"[769] Supporters of BFC Dynamo would eventually gain a reputation for being particularly violent and organized.[174] One fan of Union Berlin recalled: \\\"There was hardly an enemy mob against us, we were just too many... But the people who stood in the way of the violence-seeking BFC:ers were very few... The BFC:ers were completely organized. These hundred and fifty people, everyone knew each other. They stood as a block like a wall.\\\"[770] The book \\\"Riot Boys!\\\" by Jochen Schramm depicts the supporter scene of BFC Dynamo and contains stories of violent away trips in the early 1980s. Jochen \\\"Ellis\\\" Schramm was a member of the hooligan scene of BFC Dynamo in the 1980s.[771]\\n\\nThe development in the supporter scene of BFC Dynamo would eventually catch the attention of the authorities. The Stasi conducted a study on the violent structures of the supporter scene at the beginning of the 1980s. It found that 80 percent of those committing violent acts were 16–25 years old. Most of them were workers or students.[760] It also found that 20 percent came from families of the socialist intelligentia.[177][760] The Stasi assigned a group of two full-time officers from the district administration to the supporter scene during 1982–83 season.[772] From then, supporters of BFC Dynamo were accompanied, observed and documented.[773] This was a measure that had previously also been applied to the supporter scene of Union Berlin.[178] The authorities had allegedly been particularly alarmed when supporters of BFC Dynamo unfurled a poster in memory of Lutz Eigendorf with the text \\\"Iron Foot, we mourn you!\\\" during a match at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark in April 1983.[774][773][174] Supporters had also started a fan club in honour of Eigendorf.[753] The Stasi would try to control the supporter scene with a broad catalogue of measures: persistent talks, intimidation attempts, reporting requirements and arrests.[717][751] It would also attempt to infiltrate the fan clubs by unofficial collaborators (IM).[772] All football fan clubs in East Germany had to undergo registration.[137] According to Stasi information, BFC Dynamo had six registered fan clubs and 22 unauthorized fan clubs in 1986. Unauthorized fan clubs were those that were unregistered or did not meet DFV guidelines.[775] East German state television always tryied to hide riots from viewers. But the sound recording from football matches was the biggest problem. Additional sound systems were integrated into the stadium of BFC Dynamo for radio and television broadcasts. The system was also supposed to drown out shouts and chanting from the violent structures, so that television viewers and radio listeners would not hear anything.[776]\\n\\nThe supporter scene of BFC Dynamo came to be increasingly associated with skinheads and far-right tendencies from the mid-1980s.[174] More and more supporters of BFC Dynamo began to embrace skinhead fashion in the early 1980s.[751][717] Skinhead fashion was now considered the most provocative outfit.[751] By the mid-1980s, the club had become one of the most popular football clubs in the growing skinhead movement.[32][nb 10] The reputation of BFC Dynamo as the hated Stasi club also attracted skinheads, who used the club as a stage for their provocations.[520] Right-wing slogans and fascist chants were considered as the most challenging provocations, as anti-fascism was state doctrine and Nazism officially did not exist in East Germany.[783][137][174][751][784][637] For young people, being a Nazi was sometimes considered the sharpest form of opposition.[785] However, instances of Nazi provocations did not necessarily reflect genuine political convictions. At least some part of the \\\"drift to the right\\\" among East German youth during the 1980s was rooted in a desire to position oneself wherever the state was not.[786] One fan of BFC Dynamo said: \\\"None of us really knew anything about politics. But to raise your arm in front of the Volkspolizei was a real kick. You did that and for some of them, their whole world just fell apart\\\".[787][717][174][nb 11]\\n\\nThe first East German hooligan group developed from the supporter scene of BFC Dynamo in the 1980s. The development was partly a response to the increasing state repression against the supporter scene, notably from the Stasi.[190] An organized hooligan scene with groups, structures and training rooms, that was unique in East Germany, would eventually emerge at BFC Dynamo.[766] The hooligans of BFC Dynamo initially reacted with restraint to police intervention in the fan block. There was a risk of going to jail. However, the Volkspolizei were sometimes ruthless, especially at away matches. Towards the end of the 1980s, there was an uprising and the hooligans of BFC Dynamo now began to confront the police with violence.[794] The final of the 1987-88 FDGB-Pokal between BFC Dynamo and Carl Zeiss Jena on 4 June 1988 saw some of the most serious violence ever witnessed at an East German football match.[4] A group of 100 to 150 skinheads and other hooligans marched through Pankow to the Stadion der Weltjugend for the match. They chanted fascist slogans and clashed with other supporters.[795][779] Riots then broke out in one of the blocks shortly before the end of the match. Supporters destroyed fences and threw seats at match stewards.[796] A group of 300 supporters of BFC Dynamo attempted to invade the pitch during the victory ceremony. They caused extensive damage to 60 seating benches.[786] About a year later, supporters of BFC Dynamo would also destroy large parts of a block of the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark, during the match against AS Monaco in the 1989–90 European Cup Winners\' Cup on 1 November 1989.[797][798][nb 12]\\n\\nGerman reunification\\nA wave of violence swept through the football stadiums of East Germany in 1990.[178] The collapse of the East German regime resulted in a security vacuum.[800][801][802] The Volkspolizei was overwhelmed by the amount of disorder and often reluctant to use enough force, due to the political situation.[803][178][804][264]\\n\\n\\nSupporters of FC Berlin during the away match against FC Carl Zeiss Jena on 8 April 1990.\\nMasked supporters of FC Berlin rioted in central Jena before the away match against FC Carl Zeiss Jena in the 1989-90 DDR-Oberliga on 8 April 1990. They broke shop windows, smashed windscreens of police vehicles with stones and left a trail of destruction in the city center. Supporters of FC Berlin also fired flares at police officers during the match.[805] The disorder at the stadium would not cease and the match was eventually interrupted.[32] The riots in Jena caught rare attention by East German state media, which until then had been generally silent about football related disorder.[32][751]\\n\\n\\nA flare thrown on the pitch during the match between FC Carl Zeiss Jena and FC Berlin on 8 April 1990.\\nThere were now riots now after every home match in FC Berlin. After the last home match in the 1989-90 NOFV-Oberliga against BSG Wismut Aue on 26 May 1990, a group of 300 supporters of FC Berlin marched from Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark towards Alexanderplatz. Windows were smashed, cars were damaged and a minibus was overturned as they made their way. Supporters met at the Marx-Engels-Forum. A group of 200 people then formed a human swastika in front of the Volkspolizei. There were 21 arrests, and the police seized knives, knuckle dusters and pepper spray.[806]\\n\\nHooligans who had left East Germany for various reasons in recent years rejoined the hooligan scene after the opening of the Berlin Wall.[265][807] Some were former skinheads who had been deported by the Stasi to West Germany in the late 1980s. Now they chanted things such as \\\"Who should be our Führer? Erich Mielke!\\\" as a provocative fun, to the dismay of the club.[265][804] Supporters who returned from West Germany also brought back a new fashion based on designer clothing labels and expensive sportswear, which was adopted by the supporter scene.[265][767] While combat boots and bomber jackets were now common at many places in East Germany, some supporters of BFC Dynamo wanted to differentiate themselves. Expensive sneakers was now the new fashion in the supporter scene.[717][807][808] Brands such as Diesel, Iceberg, Chevignon, Adidas, Best Company, New Balance and Ray Ban became popular.[767][265][808][760]\\n\\nThe reputation of the hooligans of FC Berlin attracted a large number of new young people who joined the hooligan scene.[265] A series of violence occurred in connection with the cup match between Union Berlin and FC Berlin in the Second round of the 1990-91 FDGB-Pokal on 23 September 1990. Hooligans of FC Berlin stormed the home stands of the Stadion an der Alten Försterei armed with clubs and flares and hunted down supporters of Union Berlin.[263][809] Riots broke out after match. Aound 250 hooligans threw gravel and other objects at the police. At least 14 police officers were injured in the clashes.[810] Serious riots then continued in the city, involving hundreds of supporters. Street battles broke out in areas of East Berlin, even spreading to Kreuzberg in West Berlin.[811] One supporter of FC Berlin said: \\\"In 1990, thanks to the many departures to the West, it became clear relatively quickly that there was no flowerpot to be won with the current team. We then turned our attention to other things.\\\"[812]\\n\\nHooligans in East Germany unleashed almost unbridled violence against the representatives of the disintegrating East German state.[802] Violent riots had occurred in Rostock, Dresden, Erfurt and East Berlin.[802] Police had been forced to shoot warning shots during violent riots in Leipzig and one match in the 1990-91 NOFV-Oberliga had already been abandoned due to riots in the stadium.[803][813][814][815][nb 13] The situation peaked during a match between FC Sachsen Leipzig and FC Berlin on 3 November 1990. Supporters of FC Berlin travelled in large numbers to Leipzig for the match.[802] The police had only 219 officers available for the match.[264] There were clashes at the Leipzig main railway station, with one police officer injured and 50 supporters taken into custody.[264][816] A first group of around 100 supporters of FC Berlin entered the Georg-Schwarz-Sportpark in time for kick-off.[802] They were joined by a hooligans of 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig, who had forced their way into the stadium.[817][818][819][777] Supporters of both camps tried to attack each other in the stadium and the police had difficulties in maintaining a buffer zone.[264] A second group of up to 400 supporters of FC Berlin arrived later at the nearby Leipzig-Leutzsch S-Bahn station at Am Ritterschlößchen street.[802][264] Fireworks were fired as they made their way to the stadium.[820] The group was blocked from entering the stadium by police equipped with helmets and shields, despite showing valid tickets.[821][822][265] The supporters were not given any reason.[820] They were then pushed back by the police using tear gas and truncheons.[802][264][821] The group returned to the S-Bahn station and made an attempt to reach the stadium from the Pettenkofer Straße instead.[802] They were again blocked by police who immediately used truncheons.[802][820]\\n\\nRiots broke out at the S-Bahn station.[802] The station building was vandalized and numerous cars were smashed or burned, including at least one W 50 police truck and one police car.[802][264][820][816] The police was allegedly outnumbered.[823][nb 14] Cobblestones were thrown at the police waiting at the Pettenkofer Straße.[802] The police now decided to use their firearms.[802] 18-year old supporter Mike Polley (de) from the locality of Malchow in Berlin was hit by several bullets and instantly killed.[265][807] He was allegedly about to bend down to a friend when hit.[826] Several others were injured and at least another three people were seriously injured.[801][264][821] One supporter of FC Berlin was hit in the head and suffered critical injuries, but survived.[265] The police had fired between 50 and 100 shots in about a minute, from 11 different police pistols.[264][821] Reports and sources vary on what happened on the scene and how the situation was.[264] The police claim that they were surrounded.[823] But this was rebuffed by an eyewitness.[820] Shots had been fired from distances as long as 30–40 meters.[264][820] The police had also fired at fleeing supporters.[820] One supporter was hit while trying to escape into an S-Bahn train.[820] Not every injured had come with the supporters of FC Berlin. Also an uninvolved woman was shot in the leg.[264]\\n\\nAfter the shootings, some supporters of FC Berlin left the S-Bahn station by train.[823] Many were shaken, but other wanted to take revenge.[820] A group of supporters stopped a tram, kicked the driver out and maneuvered it down town.[265][802] Riots now continued in central Leipzig, where policed presence was low.[820] The riots in central Leipzig continued for several hours and the damage was extensive.[265][802][777] Supporters of FC Berlin devastated entire streets.[823] All shop windows on the Nikolaistraße opposite the main railway station were broken.[816] There was rampage at the Park Hotel.[818][824] The ground floor of a department store on Brühl was destroyed.[824] Numerous cars were demolished and up to 31 shops were smashed and looted.[824][823][264] Supporters clashed with transport police at the main railway station. New shots were fired by the police, but no one was injured.[823][265][264]\\n\\n\\nSupporters of FC Berlin commemorate Mike Polley at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark, during the match against HFC Chemie in the 1990-91 NOFV-Oberliga on 10 November 1990.\\nMike Polley was considered a beginner in the supporter scene.[823] A demonstration against police violence with 1,000 participants was arranged in Prenzlauer Berg by supporters of FC Berlin after the match against HFC Chemie on 10 November 1990.[32][264][777] The demonstration was supported by the recently founded Fanprojekt Berlin.[264] Also professional FC Berlin players such as Waldemar Ksienzyk participated in the march.[257] The demonstration received support from politicians such as Lena Schraut from the Alternative List and from left-wing activists, notably from the occupied houses near Senefelderplatz at the Schönhauser Allee.[777][265] The friendly match between East Germany and West Germany that was planned to be held on the Zentralstadion in Leipzig on 21 November 1990 was cancelled for security reasons and due to the tense situation among football supporters after the shootings.[264][777] An investigation against ten police officers was opened, but closed in April 1992.[264][777] The exact circumstances around the death of Mike Polley were never fully clarified.[822][827]\\n\\nStadium attendance collapsed in 1990. Many supporters of BFC Dynamo stopped attending matches after the Peaceful revolution, as the best players were sold off to clubs in West Germany, sports performance slumped, tickets prices rose, mass unemployment spread and hooligans had come to dominate the stands.[178][801][637][828] Some shifted their focus to ice hockey instead.[829] The average league attendance of the 1990–91 NOFV-Oberliga was by far the lowest in the league history.[801] BFC Dynamo was hit particularly hard by the decline. Average league attendance at BFC Dynamo had dropped from 8,385 in the 1988–89 season to 1,076 in the 1990–91 season.[830][831][832] Ordinary supporters had disappeared. Only young supporters remained in the stadium at FC Berlin in 1990 and 1991.[178]\\n\\nThe violent faction of FC Berlin would come to shape the entire 1990–91 season.[265] Matches involving FC Berlin were all security matches.[264] A group of 500–600 supporters of FC Berlin travelled with a special train to Rostock for an away match against F.C. Hansa Rostock on 16 March 1991.[265][833] The police did not manage to control the situation despite a record strong presence of more than 600 officers.[833][834] Riots broke out in central Rostock, where supporters smashed shops, demolished cars and attacked people.[265][767][833] Supporters without tickets stormed the Ostseestadion and there were fights with supporters of F.C. Hansa Rostock around the stadium.[833] Riots at the train station after the match had to be suppressed by the police with tear gas and water cannons.[833][265] The damage was again extensive. Up to 17 shops at the Wismarischen Straße were smashed and looted, the train station was devastated and the special train was vandalized.[834] 21 people were injured in the clashes, including nine police officers.[835][836] The damages amounted to around 750,000 Deutsche Marks.[836] The Minister President of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern Alfred Gomolka believed the Stasi was behind the riots. He claimed that the hooligans of FC Berlin were controlled by \\\"Stasi remnants\\\" who wanted to cause \\\"destabilization\\\". Also the Interior Minister of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern Georg Diederich saw the riots as a political confrontation. As a proof, they pointed to the fact that supporters of FC Berlin came with East German flags and that the club had pre-financed the special train to Rostock.[835]\\n\\nThe youth television programme Elf99 on Deutscher Fernsehfunk (DFF) ran a special story on the hooligans of FC Berlin in August 1991. The story was called \\\"Elf-Spezial: Das randalierende Rätsel – Der Berliner Hooligans zwischen Wahn und Scham?\\\" and can be found on YouTube as of 2020.[837] About 200 supporters of FC Berlin traveled to the top match against Greifswalder SC 1926 in the 1991-92 NOFV-Oberliga Nord on 3 November 1991. Repeated riots broke out during the match. Supporters of FC Berlin claim they were insulted as \\\"Stasi-pigs!\\\" by spectators in Greifswald. Supporters of FC Berlin fought with other spectators and the stadium facilities were demolished in the riots.[838] Up to 100 hooligans of FC Berlin also attacked an asylum shelter that was located right next to the stadium in Greifswald.[839][840][788][841] SV Hafen Rostock 61 subsequently postponed its upcoming league match at home against FC Berlin for security reasons.[842][841]\\n\\nHooliganism\\nThe hooligan scene of FC Berlin at the beginning of the 1990s was considered the most notorious for years in Germany. Hooligans of FC Berlin were subsequently involved in numerous fights in stadiums, woods and meadows.[178] Organized fights with other hooligan groups began in 1992 and 1993.[265] However, hooligans of FC Berlin were also involved in fights with squatters and other left-wing groups in the 1990s.[265] 25 supporters of FC Berlin fought 40 people from the left-wing scene in front of a pub on the Straße der Pariser Kommune in Friedrichshain on 17 April 1995. Several people were injured.[843] A number of people allegedly associated with the hooligan scene of FC Berlin attacked formerly occupied houses and a meeting point for left-wing football supporters at Brunnenstraße 6 and 7 in Mitte on the night of 6 September 1997. A punk concert was held on the premises at the time. Four people had to be hospitalized with injuries.[844]\\n\\nIn the years after German reunification, the club\'s eternal outside image attracted people from the underground.[752] Playing for meager crowds in regional leagues, the club eventually became a meeting place for individuals from Berlin\'s far-right, hooligan and criminal underground.[637][845] By the mid-1990s, the hooligan scene of FC Berlin had developed a connection to the eastern Berlin bouncer scene.[387] The eastern Berlin bouncer scene would eventually be almost completely organized from the hooligan scene of BFC Dynamo.[799][846] One of those involved in the assault on French policeman Daniel Nivel during the 1998 FIFA World Cup had connections to the hooligan scene of FC Berlin.[637] The same man was later linked to organized crime and eventfully involved in a high-profile drug trafficking case.[847][848][637]\\n\\nThe match between BFC Dynamo and Berlin Türkspor 1965 in the final of the 1998–99 Berlin Cup on 11 May 1999 was marked by violence. Supporters of BFC Dynamo directed far-right chants and others provocations against Berlin Türkspor 1965 during the match.[849] 400 supporters of BFC Dynamo invaded the pitch after the final whistle to celebrate the title. Some supporters also attacked players of Berlin Türkspor 1965. Two players of Berlin Türkspor 1965 were injured, one of them had suffered a stab wound.[850] BFC Dynamo Club President Volkmar Wanski was able to prevent a total escalation by giving a calming speech over the stadium microphone.[851] He immediately apologized for the behavior of the supporters at the press conference after the match.[850] Older supporters of BFC Dynamo openly expressed their contempt for the far-right supporters that had visited the match.[852] BFC Dynamo and Berlin Türkspor 1965 agreed to meet in a friendly match later in the season and to organize a joint meal for players and responsible.[853] Wanski made it clear in the speakers ahead of the last home match against FC Rot-Weiß Erfurt in the 1998-99 Regionalliga Nordost on 15 May 1999 that \\\"anyone who cannot behave has no business in our stadium\\\".[854]\\n\\nSerious riots broke out in Prenzlauer Berg after the match between BFC Dynamo and 1. FC Union Berlin in the Round of 16 of the 2000–01 Berlin Cup at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark on 24 March 2001. Around 150 supporters of BFC Dynamo attacked the police after the match, as they wanted to storm the block of Union Berlin.[855][342] Around 500 supporters of BFC Dynamo then attacked police at Eberswalder Straße.[342] The police employed water cannons against supporters at Eberswalder Straße and Schönhauser Allee. Nine people, including four police officers, were injured.[855][342] BFC Dynamo Club President Karin Halsch (de) and 1. FC Union Berlin Club President Heiner Bertram criticized the police in unison for provocations during the match and for triggering riots.[341] Karin Halsch simultaneously expressed sadness that the riots destroyed a lot of reconstruction work in the club and announced that there would be many stadium bans.[341][856] Also coach Jürgen Bogs spoke out about \\\"senseless violence\\\" that would once again fall back on the club, but also criticized the police for provocations.[341] Many of those involved in the riots did not come from the supporter scene of BFC Dynamo. Many were visitors from other cities in Germany.[387]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo had the highest number of violent supporters in Germany in 2005.[857] Violence broke out during the match between Tennis Borussia Berlin and BFC Dynamo in the 2004-05 NOFV-Oberliga Nord at the Mommsenstadion on 11 February 2005. A flare was lit and a couple of bangers set off in the guest block at the beginning of the second half. Police then decided to intervene against away supporters. Police officers were pelted with beer cups and attacked by supporters of BFC Dynamo when they entered gest block. Eight police officers were injured and 11 supporters of BFC Dynamo arrested. BFC Dynamo criticized the police operation as \\\"disproportionate\\\".[858][431] Supporters of BFC Dynamo claimed that they had been called \\\"Nazis\\\", \\\"Ossis\\\" and \\\"Unioners\\\" by police officers. Riots had broken out also when Tennis Borussia Berlin played 1. FC Union Berlin in round of 16 of the 2004-05 Berlin Cup at the Mommsenstadion a couple of weeks before.[431]\\n\\nFighting between supporters of BFC Dynamo and police again broke out in connection with the match between BFC Dynamo and SV Yeşilyurt at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark on 24 April 2005. The mood had been tense during the match. The situation escalated when celebrating supporters of BFC Dynamo attacked the fence after the final whistle. Police intervened with water hoses, batons and tear gas against supporters of BFC Dynamo. Four police officers were injured and five hooligans arrested. One police officer suffered a broken nose and another one a concussion.[859][860] Riots again broke out in connection to a match between BFC Dynamo and SV Yeşilyurt at the opening of the 2005-06 NOFV-Oberliga Nord at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark 5 August 2005. The match was attended by 1,200 supporters of BFC Dynamo. Hooligans in the crowd threw bottles and stones at police officers during the match. Fights between hooligans and police then broke out after match. Around 150 hooligans had participated in the riots, according to police information.[861][438] BFC Dynamo spokesperson Yiannis Kaufmann claimed that those involved were a \\\"mob of travelling fans who wants to cause trouble everywhere and now discredit the BFC\\\".[861] As many as 13 police officers were injured in the riots.[439][440]\\n\\n\\nThe Stadion im Sportforum on 14 May 2006.\\nPolice made a controversial raid against the discotheque Jeton in Friedrichshain where supporters of BFC Dynamo and other people had gathered to celebrate in connection to a fan tournament in memory of Mike Polley on the night of 20 August 2005. The fan tournament had been visited by numerous teams, including teams from FC St. Pauli, 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig, Aberdeen F.C., VfL Bochum and Malmö FF.[862][863][864] The large-scale police operation involved 300 officers, including 100 members of the SEK.[865][866][867] 158 persons were arrested. Among the detainees were 19 Category C-supporters and 22 Category B-supporters.[439][866] Supporters filed numerous complaints against the police for use of excessive violence.[868] 39 people at the discotheque were injured.[440] Also bystanders were affected.[440] Police initially claimed they had been pelted with bottles and furnishings, but later corrected their statement and admitted that there had been no resistance.[865][440][439] The police had allegedly beaten defenseless people.[869] Police stated that the raid was a preventative measure on short notice to prevent hooligans from organizing for the upcoming match against Union Berlin on 21 August 2005.[440][866] There were speculations that police also took revenge for riots during the match between BFC Dynamo and SV Yeşilyurt at the opening of the season.[440][439] More than 1,000 police officers were deployed to the derby and the match was played without crowd trouble.[866][867] Banners in solidarity with the supporters of BFC Dynamo were displayed in 17 football stadiums across Germany during the following matchdays.[870]\\n\\nThe return match between BFC Dynamo and Union Berlin in the 2005–06 NOFV-Oberliga Nord was played at the Stadion im Sportforum on 13 May 2006. The standing was 1–1 when supporters of BFC Dynamo invaded the pitch in an attempt to storm the block of Union Berlin around the 75th minute.[871] Supporters of Union Berlin fled in panic.[872] The match was abandoned and Union Berlin was awarded a 2–0 win.[871][873] The players of BFC Dynamo wore the motto \\\"No power of violence\\\" on their shirts in the following match against BFC Preussen away on 17 May 2006.[874] The Stadion im Sportforum was temporarily closed for matches in the NOFV-Oberliga Nord after the riots.[457] The riots during the match against 1. FC Union Berlin threw the club into a financial crisis. Treasurer Sven Radicke concluded: \\\"Four years of our work were ruined in five minutes\\\".[459]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo has often attracted hooligans from outside, and hooligans who are otherwise not involved in the supporter scene, to high-profile matches.[520][875][530] The club has repeatedly complained about so-called \\\"riot tourists\\\".[530][876] Riots broke out after the match against Berliner AK 07 in the final of the 2009–10 Berlin Cup at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark on 2 June 2010. Around 100–150 supporters of BFC Dynamo attempted to invade the pitch after the final whistle.[519][875] Match stewards and players of BFC Dynamo threw themselves in to restrain supporters and prevent further riots.[519][877][875][520] One of them was goalkeeper Nico Thomaschewski, who later received an award from the Berlin Football Association (BFV) for his actions.[875] Polish fans of Pogoń Szczecin were allegedly linked to the riots.[875] Those who had invaded the pitch were whistled by other supporters of BFC Dynamo when they returned to the stands.[878]\\n\\nMajor riots then occurred after the match against 1. FC Kaiserslautern in the first round of the 2011-12 DFB-Pokal at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark on 3 July 2011.[528][529] Around 200–300 supporters of BFC Dynamo invaded the buffer zone and stormed the guest block after the match.[530][520] 18 police officers and many supporters from Kaiserslautern were injured in the attack.[520] The Chairman of the Economic Council Peter Meyer openly expressed his embarrassment and disappointment over the behavior of some supporters and publicly apologized.[530] There were allegations that hooligans outside the BFC Dynamo environment had been involved.[530] While the police stated that most of those arrested were from Berlin, the club claimed it had never seen most of the recent perpetrators before.[520]\\n\\nThe contemporary supporter scene\\nThe contemporary supporter scene contains various subcultures and categories of supporters. It ranges from older supporters to younger ultras.[749] Older supporters constitute an essential part of the supporter scene.[752] Many are active in the supporter group 79er.[875] The group is credited for its commitment to the club, notably the youth teams. Its members have been supporters of BFC Dynamo since the late 1970s.[875][717]\\n\\nThe supporter scene played an important part in saving the club from bankruptcy in 2001.[637] Supporters organized a demonstration against the impending bankruptcy. The demonstration marched from the Sportforum to the Rotes Rathaus where it was met by the former club president and SPD politician Karin Halsch.[368][369] Supporters threw parties and organized collections, made donations and travelled to countries such as Austria and Switzerland to convince creditors to accept smaller pay-offs in order to save the cub.[637] Supporters also installed bucket seats at the Stadion im Sportforum and built a new clubhouse in the Sportforum during the insolvency.[729][879] The insolvency crisis remains a defining moment for older supporters.[637] The supporter scene has traditionally arranged an annual Mike-Polley-Gedenkturnier, which is a football fan tournament in memory of Mike Polley.[822][880] The first edition of the fan tournament was arranged in the Sportforum Hohenschönhausen in 2003 and comprised 28 teams.[881] A march in memory of Mike Polley in Leipzig in 2018 was attended by 850 supporters of BFC Dynamo.[882]\\n\\nNew groups of younger ultra-oriented supporters have emerged since the 2000s.[875][717] Supporter group Fraktion H was founded in 2006 by younger supporters who wanted to create more atmosphere in the stadium.[875][717] A minor ultras scene then emerged with the founding of supporter group Ultras BFC in 2011. The ultras of BFC Dynamo have initiated campaigns such as \\\"Brown is not Claret\\\" and have also engaged in football tournaments for refugees.[845][717][883][608] The club has encouraged the new groups of younger supporters and club management has taken a stand against racism and right-wing extremism.[884][883][608] Fraktion H maintains a friendship with the supporters of Eintracht Trier, while members of the now dissolved Ultras BFC have had contacts with the ultras of Swedish football club GAIS.[885]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo is affiliated with Fanprojekt Berlin, which is an independent organization that engages in socio-pedagogical fan work.[752][886] The organization supports young fans in various aspects of life and aims at promoting a positive supporter culture.[886] BFC Dynamo engages in active fan work and has taken measures to control violent elements, to exclude known violators and to distance itself from radical supporters.[752][530][883] Far-right symbols and slogans are not tolerated by the club.[752] The Chairman of the Economic Council, Peter Meyer, stated publicly in connection with a friendly match against Hertha BSC in 2007 that the club did not want people who cannot follow the rules and that \\\"anyone who shouts Nazi slogans will be thrown out of the stadium\\\".[495] Lawyer and former Vice President of BFC Dynamo René Lau said in an interview with Deutsche Welle in 2019: \\\"If you had asked me 25 years ago [if BFC had a problem with Nazis], I would have said yes. But is today\'s BFC Dynamo a Nazi club? I would vehemently dispute that.\\\"[637] A large number of stadium bans has been issued by the club since the mid-2000s.[887][530] A total of 40 stadium bans was issued only in 2006.[888][887] No riots has occurred since 2011.[752]\\n\\nThe contemporary supporter scene has includes groups such as 79er, Mythos BFC, Fraktion H, Piefkes, Ultras BFC, East Company, Riot Sport, Black Boys Dynamo, Bärenbande, Gegengerade, Hipstercrew, Märkische Jungs, Sektion Süddeutschland and Banda Invicta.[875][889][717][890] Supporter group Gegengerade is a left wing-oriented fan club.[890] A number of supporters BFC Dynamo had been members of the \\\"Anti-Fascist Football Fan Initiative\\\" (AFFI) aleady back in 1993.[891][892] Supporters of BFC Dynamo have occasionally displayed a Norwegian flag with the text \\\"Thanks Norway\\\", in memory of Norway\'s 2–0 win over Nazi Germany in the quarter-finals of the 1936 Summer Olympics. Another banner that has occasionally been displayed at the stadium contains the text \\\"There Is A Light That Never Goes Out\\\", with reference to the 1980s British cult band The Smiths.[893]\\n\\nUltras BFC announced its dissolution on 23 January 2023, after the group had lost essential material in an attack. An individual in the group was attacked by a group of people in front of his private residence and robbed of essential group material. The group apologized to the supporter scene of BFC Dynamo and consequently dissolved, but at the same time announced that this was not the end.[894] The attack has been traced to Cottbus.[895] A new supporter group named Banda Invicta eventually presented itself with a banner and a coreography on the first matchday of the 2023-24 Regionalliga Nordost on 29 July 2023. The coreography read \\\"On to a new chapter\\\".[896]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo had 100 Category C and 190 Category-B supporters in 2019.[897] Younger hooligans of BFC Dynamo have contacts with supporter group Kaliber 030 at Hertha.[637][898] 20–25 supporters of BFC Dynamo joined Hertha in the guest block of the Stadion an der Alten Försterei during the derby between Union Berlin and Hertha on 2 November 2019.[899] Older hooligans of BFC Dynamo, on the other hand, maintain friendly relationships with like-minded supporters of 1. FC Magdeburg.[637] Supporters of BFC Dynamo wanted to travel in numbers to the return leg against VfB Oldenburg in the promotion play-offs for the 3. Liga on 4 June 2022. Up to 2,500 supporters of BFC Dynamo wanted to join the team in Oldenburg.[900] Around 1,300 supporters of BFC Dynamo was eventually admitted to the Marschweg-Stadion, where they marked their presence with a banner, a scarf choreography and flares.[901][902][903]\\n\\nOne of the most well-known books in Germany about the supporter scene of BFC Dynamo is \\\"Der BFC war schuld am Mauerbau\\\" by German author Andreas Gläser (de). The book was first published in 2002 and describes the supporter scene from the late 1970s and forward. The club, its reputation and supporter scene, was also the theme of stage play \\\"Dynamoland\\\" by Gudrun Herrbold. The play was set up in 2007 and involved young football players from BFC Dynamo as well as Andreas Gläser.[784][520][904] The fanzine \\\"Zugriff\\\" is dedicated to BFC Dynamo. The fanzine has been produced by Andreas Gläser and members of supporter group Gegengerade since 2008.[905] The tenth and latest issue was published in 2014. The tenth issue came with as music CD mixed by Andreas Gläser. The CD included numerous ska and punk tracks as well as a 25 seconds long recording of Erich Mielke ranting about skinheads and punks.[749]\\n\\nMusicians from German rock band Klaus Renft Combo composed the anthem \\\"Auf, Dynamo!\\\" for BFC Dynamo in 1999.[906] German rap musician Joe Rilla has also dedicated a song to BFC Dynamo. The song is called \\\"Heb die Faust Hoch (BFC Dynamo Straßenhymne)\\\" and was released in 2008. Joe Rilla, whose real name is Hagen Stoll (de), has a background in the hooligan scene of BFC Dynamo.[907] The clothing store Hoolywood on Schönhauser Allee in Prenzlauer Berg is associated with the supporter scene of BFC Dynamo. The store was founded at the beginning of the 1990s.[752][904][908] The store has been an advertising partner of BFC Dynamo.[909]\\n\\nRivalries\\nSG Dynamo Dresden\\nThe oldest rival of BFC Dynamo is SG Dynamo Dresden. The rivalry dates back to 1954 when the team of Dynamo Dresden and its place in the DDR-Oberliga was transferred to SC Dynamo Berlin during the course of the 1954-55 season. The relocation aroused a sense of victimhood among the fans of Dynamo Dresden which would later be compounded by the successes of BFC Dynamo.[758] Matters were exacerbated when additional players of Dynamo Dresden were delegated to Dynamo Berlin by the German Football Association of the GDR (DFV) following the relegation of Dynamo Dresden after the 1962–63 season.[910] The antagonism between the two clubs was underpinned by a historical German rivalry between Prussian Berlin and Saxony.[719][911] It was fueled by contemporary resentment in Dresden at the better provision of housing and consumer goods in the East German capital.[719] East Berliners were generally unpopular outside the city limits, especially in the southern regional districts of East Germany. They were considered arrogant and clearly preferred.[751]\\n\\nDynamo Dresden slowly recovered from the relocation. The club was declared a regional district center of excellence (German: Leistungszentrum) by the regional district board of the DTSB on 5 August 1968.[912][913] The club could now draw on the best players in Bezirk Dresden.[912] Dynamo Dresden eventually re-established itself in the DDR-Oberliga and became campions once again in the 1970-71 DDR-Oberliga. BFC Dynamo and Dynamo Dresden then met in the final of the 1970-71 FDGB-Pokal. Klaus Sammer scored 1-0 for Dynamo Dresden, but Norbert Johannsen equalized on a penalty. Dynamo Dresden eventually won the match 2-1 after a second goal by Sammer in extra time.[57] Dynamo Dresden thus secured the first Double in the history of East German football.[914] However, BFC Dynamo did not go completely empty-handed from the final. The team qualified for its first UEFA competition as runners-up. Its participation in the 1971–72 European Cup Winners\' Cup would be a success.\\n\\n\\nA duel between Harald Schütze (left) and Reinhard Häfner of Dynamo Dresden (right) during a match between BFC Dynamo and Dynamo Dresden in the DDR-Oberliga in 1976.\\nBFC Dynamo met Dynamo Dresden away on the sixth matchday of the 1974-75 DDR-Oberliga on 21 September 1974. The standing was 2–2 at the end of the match, after an equalizer from Norbert Johannsen on a penalty. Shortly before the final whistle, referee Robert Pischke from Rostock awarded Dynamo Dresden a controversial penalty. Siegmar Wätzlich converted the penalty and Dynamo Dresden won the match 3–2.[915][916] The East German football weekly Die neue Fußballwoche (FuWo) commented: \\\"Shortly before the end, the same thing on the other side, but this one surprised even the objective Dresdeners about it. They hadn\'t seen any opposing influence on the falling Richter... The Berliners exploded in outrage at the penalty kick, which snatched a point from them in the last minute.\\\"[916] Dynamo Dresden finished the season in third place, two points ahead of BFC Dynamo. BFC Dynamo finished the season in fourth place, but with a better goal difference. Dynamo Dresden had thus captured the place in the 1975-76 UEFA Cup narrowly ahead of BFC Dynamo. Referee Pischke was not selected for any more DDR-Oberliga matches and eventually chose to end his refereeing career.[917] He would years later become the president of F.C. Hansa Rostock.[918]\\n\\nDynamo Dresden would come to dominate East German football in the 1970s. The team managed to capture a third consecutive league title in the 1977–78 DDR-Oberliga. What happened after is subject to various rumors. Formal title celebrations took place in June 1978 at the hotel and restaurant Bastein at Prager Straße in Dresden. Erich Mielke paid a visit as the president of SV Dynamo to congratulate the team to the title. Dynamo Dresden player Reinhard Häfner recalls how Mielke held a speech where he said that he would be happier if BFC Dynamo was champions. Mielke should have added that \\\"since BFC Dynamo is also SV Dynamo, the title stays in the family, so to speak, and that is good too\\\". According to other versions of the same event, he allegedly proclaimed that everything will be done so that in the coming year, the champion will come from Berlin, and that it was now the turn of the BFC Dynamo.[919][920][921][922][nb 15]\\n\\n\\nThomas Doll and defending Matthias Döschner of Dynamo Dresden during a match between Dynamo Dresden and BFC Dynamo in 1987.\\nBFC Dynamo stood out among other clubs within SV Dynamo. The club was located at the frontline of the Cold War. It was also a representative of the capital of East Germany. This meant that the club had to be well equipped.[67] BFC Dynamo would come to benefit from a nationwide scouting system, supported by 33 training centers (TZ) of SV Dynamo across East Germany.[68][927] No less than 40 full-time trainers worked for the club.[928] The team embarked on a period of unparalleled success in the 1978–79 season under young coach Jürgen Bogs. Dynamo Dresden had been the dominant team in East German football until then. BFC Dynamo would now be its main obstacle to success.[nb 16]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo opened the 1978-79 DDR-Oberliga with ten consecutive wins. The team thus broke the previous record of Dynamo Dresden of seven consecutive wins from the 1972-73 DDR-Oberliga. Dynamo Dresden, on the other hand, had a moderately successful start to the season and stood in second place. The two teams met in the 11th matchday in front of 33,000 spectators at Dynamo-Stadion in Dresden on 2 December 1978.[934] The match ended in a draw 1-1 after an equalizer by Hans-Jürgen Riediger for BFC Dynamo. The match was marked by crowd trouble, with 38 fans to both teams arrested.[4] 17 of the 38 fans arrested were fans of BFC Dynamo.[935] Inexperienced linesman Günter Supp should allegedly have missed an offside position on Riediger in the situation leading up to the equalizer.[936][937] There were accusations in Dresden that the match had been manipulated by the referees in favor of BFC Dynamo.[4][180][201] This alleged manipulation was cited as yet another example of discrimination against the Saxon city in comparison with East Berlin.[4][180] BFC Dynamo continued to lead the league for the rest of the season. The team finally secured its first DDR-Oberliga title after defeating Dynamo Dresden 3–1 in the 24th match day in front of 22,000 spectators at Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark on 6 June 1979.[938]\\n\\nThe 1979-80 DDR-Oberliga would be tight race between the two rivals. Dynamo Dresden led the league for most of the season. Dynamo Dresden was still in first place before the last matchday. However, BFC Dynamo was only one point behind. The two rivals met at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark in the last matchday of the league season on 10 May 1980. Dynamo Dresden only needed a draw to win the league title. There was huge excitement around the match and the stadium was sold out. Die neue Fußballwoche (FuWo) reported on \\\"international match atmosphere\\\".[939] The standing was 0-0 for a long time. Dynamo Dresden player Peter Kotte fell in the BFC Dynamo penalty area with about 15 minutes left of regular time, but Dynamo Dresden was denied a penalty.[940] Norbert Trieloff instead scored a goal for BFC Dynamo just a moment later. BFC Dynamo eventually won the match 1-0 and captured its second consecutive league title in front of 30,000 spectators. Dynamo Dresden would not come this close to BFC Dynamo in the league until the end of the 1980s. It was rumoured that referee Hans Kulicke from Oderberg had favored BFC Dynamo. However, also BFC Dynamo had been denied a chance to decide the match. A goal by Hartmut Pelka had been disallowed by referee Kulicke due to a foul on Dynamo Dresden goalkeeper Bernd Jakubowski.[921]\\n\\nBoth clubs were affiliated to SV Dynamo and supported by the security organs. However, BFC Dynamo was more associated with the Stasi, while Dynamo Dresden was more associated with the Volkspolizei.[941] BFC Dynamo was known as the favourite club of the head of the Stasi Erich Mielke.[942] Dynamo Dresden, on the other hand, was patronaged by Volkspolizei Lieutenant general Willi Nyffenegger. Nyffenegger was the long-time head of the regional district authority of the Volkspolizei in Bezirk Dresden.[943] However, also Dynamo Dresden had supporters in the Stasi. The Stasi had helped Dynamo Dresden to obtain secret information about the line-up of FC Bayern Munich before the match between Dynamo Dresden and FC Bayern Munich in the 1973–74 European Cup on 7 November 1973.[944] Dynamo Dresden would also be supported by Stasi Major general Horst Böhm in the 1980s.[945] Böhm was the head of the regional district administration of the Stasi in Bezirk Dresden.[946][947][758] He was a committed local patriot when it came to Dynamo Dresden and a sponsoring member of the club.[948][947][949] The antagonism between the two clubs also spread to the Stasi Guards Regiment \\\"Felix E. Dzerzhinsky\\\".[719][4] The behavior of members of a Dresden unit during a match between the two teams in 1985 was likened to that of \\\"rioting fans\\\" by another Stasi officer.[719] Some Stasi guards had hurled abuse at BFC Dynamo players, shouting \\\"Bent champions!\\\" as they left the pitch.[758]\\n\\nResentment in Dresden over the rise of BFC Dynamo was worsened when three top players of Dynamo Dresden, Gerd Weber, Peter Kotte and Matthias Müller, were arrested on suspicion of planning to defect to West Germany in 1981.[950][4] Weber had solicited plans to defect, but the other two had not.[951] Weber received a prison sentence and a lifetime ban from playing football at any level in East Germany, while Kotte and Müller received lifetime bans from playing in the top two tiers for alleged complicity.[950][4][952] Neither would return to the Oberliga. The punishment against the three players led to rumors and protests in Dresden.[950] They also fueled local patriotism and anti-Berlin sentiments in Dresden.[950]\\n\\nFans of Dynamo Dresden saw the lifetime bans on Weber, Kotte and Müller as \\\"an order from Erich Mielke\\\" designed to weaken Dynamo Dresden.[950] Also, Kotte and Klaus Sammer has claimed they were part of a delibate plan by Mielke to weaken Dynamo Dresden.[953][954] However, such claims are doubtful.[953] The three players had been reported by an unofficial collaborator (IM) and Mielke was convinced that all three were originally prepared to defect.[951][953] Kotte was not an isolated case. The great fear of footballers, fans and officials who had fled East Germany was omnipresent at the Stasi.[955] Kotte and Müller knew about the intentions of Weber.[950] Their failure to inform authorities was critical.[950] Former SED First Secretary in Bezik Dresden Hans Modrow concludes that the measures against the three were \\\"generally cautious\\\", given the completely different consequences for other East German citizens in similar contexts. After all, the three were also members of the armed organs (German: Bewaffnete Organe der DDR) with ranks.[956] Müller said in an interview with Dresdner Neueste Nachrichten in 2011 that he \\\"knew one hundred percent\\\" that the uncompromising actions against the three players were a deliberate attempt by the Stasi to weaken Dynamo Dresden in order to secure the supremacy of BFC Dynamo.[957]\\n\\n\\nBFC Dynamo midfielder Bernd Schulz celebrates a goal against Dynamo Dresden in the DFV-Supercup together with Thomas Doll (left) and Jörg Fügner (right) in 1989.\\nBFC Dynamo and Dynamo Dresden would be the two main contenders for titles in East German football during the 1980s. BFC Dynamo dominated the DDR-Oberliga and won consecutive titles, while Dynamo Dresden had major success in the FDGB-Pokal. The two teams met in the 1981-82 FDGB-Pokal and 1983-84 FDGB-Pokal final. Dynamo Dresden won both finals and thus stopped BFC Dynamo from completing the Double.[940] The teams then also met in the 1984-85 FDGB-Pokal final. The performance of the referees in the final was controversial. A review by the DFV found that 30 percent of the referee decisions during the match had been wrong, and that 80 percent of those had been of disadvantage to Dynamo Dresden.[958] Referee Manfred Roßner was banned one year from officiating matches above second tier after the final.[959][960][958] However, nothing emerged that indicated that Roßner had been bought by the Stasi.[961] Dynamo Dresden won the final 3–2 in front of 48,000 spectators at the Stadion der Weltjugend. It was the fourth loss for BFC Dynamo against Dynamo Dresden in the final of the FDGB-Pokal and the third time that Dynamo Dresden had stopped the team from completing the Double.[940] However, BFC Dynamo would eventually succeed in completing the Double in the 1987–88 season, defeating FC Carl Zeiss Jena 2–0 in final of the 1987–88 FDGB-Pokal.\\n\\nDisturbances by spectators was a regular occurrence at matches between the two teams.[758] BFC Dynamo was met by immense hostility during away matches in Dresden. Fans of BFC Dynamo would respond to the hatred they met by singing chants in praise of Erich Mielke as a provocation.[758][178] They also made fun of the food shortage in Dresden.[753] Fans of BFC Dynamo are known to have brought coveted tropical fruits, that were only available in East Berlin, to away matches in Saxony. The fruits were then thrown at the home crowd.[178][753][751][nb 17] In Dresden they threw green bananas at the home fans and shouted: \\\"We brought you something - Bananas, bananas!\\\".[753] East German state television would always try to hide riots from viewers and sound engineers also had to drown out chants that were considered negative, such as \\\"Stasi out\\\". The match between BFC Dynamo and SG Dynamo Dresden was the most explosive encounter. At one point, the match between BFC Dynamo and SG Dynamo Dresden was even ordered to be recorded completely without sound.[776] A group of about 250 hooligans of Dynamo Dresden chanted anti-Semitic slogans against BFC Dynamo, such as \\\"Berlin Jews!\\\" and \\\"Jews\' sow!, during the match between the two teams in the 1987-88 DDR-Oberliga in East Berlin on 6 April 1988.[792][963] A number of supporters of SG Dynamo Dresden were then allegedly arrested after the match.[963]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo\'s ten-year dominance in the league was eventually broken by Dynamo Dresden in the 1988–89 season. BFC Dynamo won a second consecutive cup title in the 1988-89 FDGB-Pokal, but Dynamo Dresden became the new champion in the 1988-89 DDR-Oberliga. BFC Dynamo and Dynamo Dresden then met in the first ever DFV-Supercup in 1989. BFC Dynamo won the match 4–1 in front of 22,347 spectators at the Stadion der Freundschaft in Cottbus and became the first and only winner of the DFV-Supercup in the history of East German football.\\n\\nBFC Dynamo and Dynamo Dresden met 60 times in the Oberliga, FDGB-Pokal and DFV-Supercup between 1966 and 1991. BFC Dynamo won 21 matches and Dynamo Dresden won 27 matches. BFC Dynamo and Dynamo Dresden also met 10 times in the Regionalliga Nordost between 1995 and 2000. BFC Dynamo won 3 matches and Dynamo Dresden won 5 matches. The last meeting ended 1–1 and took place in the 1999-00 Regionalliga Nordost on 26 April 2000. The two teams rarely meet these days, because Dynamo Dresden regularly appears in the second or third tier of the German football league system. Former Dynamo Dresden player Ralf Minge expressed in an interview in 2018 his satisfaction that Dynamo Dresden has advanced past BFC Dynamo, but also said that he would not mind new duels with BFC Dynamo and that duels with BFC Dynamo \\\"have a certain charm\\\".[964]\\n\\n1. FC Union Berlin\\nFurther information: Berlin derby\\nBFC Dynamo and 1. FC Union Berlin were founded only a few days apart. Both clubs were formed during the reorganization of East German football in December 1965 and January 1966, when the football departments of ten sports clubs (SC) were reorganized into dedicated football clubs.[965] However, Union Berlin was not part of the original plan. Two football clubs had already been planned for East Berlin. They were to be formed from the football departments of SC Dynamo Berlin and ASK Vorwärts Berlin.[64] In addition, TSC Berlin played only in the second tier DDR-Liga at the time.[965][64] The founding of Union Berlin probably owed much to the intervention of the powerful Herbert Warnke.[965][762][966] Herbert Warnke was the chairman of the national state trade union FDGB and a member of the SED Politburo.[965] Dynamo Berlin and Vorwärts Berlin were both associated with the armed and security organs.[965][64] Herbert Warnke therefore argued for the formation of a civilian club for the working people of East Berlin.[965][64] He would be a passionate fan of Union Berlin.[967] Another high-ranking SED politician who pushed for the founding a civilian football club in East Berlin was the SED First Secretary in East Berlin and SED Politburo member Paul Verner.[968] Verner held a speech at the founding ceremony of Union Berlin.[969]\\n\\nBoth BFC Dynamo and Union Berlin belonged to the elite in East German football.[762][970] The new football clubs were intended as centers of excellence, with the right to draw on talents within designated geographical areas.[4][64] BFC Dynamo was supported by the Stasi, while Union Berlin was supported by the FDGB.[971][972][nb 18] However, Union Berlin was able to trace its origins back to FC Olympia Oberschöneweide in 1906.[753] BFC Dynamo had no history before East Germany. The supporters of Union Berlin therefore considered their club to be a genuine football club, unlike BFC Dynamo.[762] However, even as a civilian club, Union Berlin was also part of the sports political system.[177][975][65] The founding of the Union Berlin was organized by the then SED First Secretary in Köpenick Hans Modrow.[976] Like Herbert Warnke, Hans Modrow would be a sponsoring member of the club.[971][976] The most important positions on the board of Union Berlin were exclusively held by directors of state-owned factories or SED representatives.[65] Union Berlin was state-funded and all decisions in club had to be reported to the all-powerful central sports agency DTSB.[975] The DTSB stood in turn under direct control of the SED Central Committee.[977]\\n\\nThe rivalry between BFC Dynamo and Union Berlin began in the mid-1960s. It was initially based on the geographical proximity to each other.[66] BFC Dynamo and Union Berlin were two clubs from East Berlin in the DDR-Oberliga.[66] BFC Dynamo struggled in the 1966-67 DDR-Oberliga and was threatened with relegation. The feud between the two clubs began when fans of Union Berlin mocked BFC Dynamo with a banner saying \\\"We greet the relegated\\\" during a league match at the Stadion an der Alten Försterei on 26 April 1967.[45][972] Union Berlin won the match by 3–0 and BFC Dynamo was eventually relegated to the DDR-Liga at the end of the season.[45] While BFC Dynamo was playing in the second tier DDR-Liga, Union Berlin surprisingly won the 1967–68 FDGB-Pokal.[762] However, BFC Dynamo immediately bounced back and managed to establish itself in the DDR-Oberliga. Union Berlin would then itself be relegated to the DDR-Liga after the 1968-69 DDR-Oberliga, but also managed to return to the DDR-Oberliga after just one season in the second tier. Union Berlin would be the stronger of the two teams until the 1970s.[978]\\n\\nThe rivalry between the two clubs intensified in the early 1970s.[66] The player of Union Berlin, Klaus Korn, was suspended after a heated derby in the 1970–71 DDR-Oberliga at the Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum on 28 October 1970.[66][45] The performance of the referees had been \\\"catastrophic\\\" according to private notes from the then Second Club Secretary and Vice President of Union Berlin Günter Mielis, and the match ended with riots.[66][979][980] Klaus Korn had insulted players in BFC Dynamo with slurs such as \\\"Stasi-pig\\\". The DFV Legal Commission imposed a one-year ban on Klaus Korn after a circumstantial trial.[981][982] The DFV Legal Commission also demanded that Union Berlin considered his exclusion from the club. Klaus Korn was then excluded from the club and would never play in the DDR-Oberliga again.[981][982][66][45] Unrest broke out again at a derby in Hohenschönhausen one year later. Eight spectators were arrested after the match between BFC Dynamo and Union Berlin in the 1971–72 DDR-Oberliga at the Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum on 28 December 1971.[983] The match was attended by 14,000 spectators and the stadium was sold out.[984][712]\\n\\nThe football landscape in East Berlin changed before the 1971–72 season. Vorwärts Berlin was relocated to Frankfurt an der Oder on 31 July 1971. BFC Dynamo and Union Berlin were from now on the only major football clubs in East Berlin.[985] The relocation meant that BFC Dynamo could now take over the role of the dominant team for the armed organs in East Berlin. The team would also have opportunity to eventually move into the larger and more centrally located Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark, which led to increased interest in the club and growing attendance numbers.[66] The districts in East Berlin had previously been divided between BFC Dynamo, Vorwärts Berlin and Union Berlin. Each club was able to recruit young players from training centers (TZ) in their districts.[64][65] All training centers that had previously belonged to Vorwärts Berlin were now given to BFC Dynamo.[64][65] The DTSB allegedly saw more potential in BFC Dynamo.[64] BFC Dynamo now had access to two thirds of all training centers (TZ) in East Berlin.[65][35] This meant that BFC Dynamo had gained a much stronger position in East Berlin than Union Berlin when it came to recruiting young players.[978] FC Vorwärts Frankfurt was given Bezirk Potsdam as a catchment area, in addition to Bezirk Frankfurt. Bezirk Potsdam had previously been assigned to Union Berlin and thus had to be handed over to Vorwärts Frankfurt. This further weakened Union Berlin in relation to BFC Dynamo.[986][65][nb 19]\\n\\nUnion Berlin was relegated to the DDR-Liga after the 1972–73 season. The Union Berlin star and national team player Reinhard Lauck was transferred to BFC Dynamo after the relegation.[987] The loss of Lauck was a hard blow for the team. Lauck had contributed greatly to the victory in the final of the 1967–68 FDGB-Pokal and was well-liked among the supporters of Union Berlin.[987] Supporters of Union Berlin are said to have gathered outside his apartment, to appeal to him to stay in the team and play in the second tier.[988][989] But Lauck had already decided to change team.[988][990] The DFV had allegedly advised him to switch to BFC Dynamo in order to continue playing in the national team.[987] According to a regulation in the 1970 DFV Football Resolution (German: DFV-Fußballbeschluss), national team players in clubs that had been relegated from the DDR-Oberliga should switch clubs in order to remain competitive.[991] Lauck would make a successful appearance for East Germany in the 1974 FIFA World Cup and would win gold with East Germany in the 1976 Summer Olympics.[987][989] Lauck became the team captain of BFC Dynamo in the 1974–75 season.[82] He would later win two league titles with BFC Dynamo before ending his career due to a knee injury.[989][992]\\n\\nUnion Berlin would remain in the DDR-Liga for several seasons. Instead of playing matches against BFC Dynamo in the DDR-Oberliga, the team was now left to compete with the reserve team of BFC Dynamo, the BFC Dynamo II. Union Berlin would also suffer more blows which further weakened its position in relation to BFC Dynamo. Herbert Warnke passed in 1975 and was replaced as chairman of the FDGB by Harry Tisch.[971] Harry Tisch had begun his political career in Rostock and chose instead to give the support of the FDGB to F.C. Hansa Rostock.[971] Union Berlin thus lost the support of the FDGB and also no longer had any support in the top of the political hierarchy.[993] From no on, the club could only rely on support from the district administration of the SED in East Berlin and local state-owned enterprises, such as VEB Kabelwerk Oberspree (KWO) and VEB Transformatorenwerk Oberschöneweide (TRO).[994][971]\\n\\nThe DTSB and the DFV had also continued their efforts to concentrate resources on a few clubs during the 1970s.[995] A number of football clubs became specially promoted focus clubs in the 1970 DFV Football Resolution.[60][996] The focus clubs were meant to be strengthened through player transfers. Players in teams that had been relegated from the DDR-Oberliga should also switch to focus clubs.[997] The focus clubs were also equipped with more staff as well as better material and technical conditions.[998][60][996] BFC Dynamo became the focus club in East Berlin.[999][1000][995][nb 20] Even more advantages were then given to the focus clubs in the 1976 DFV Football Resolution. The focus clubs would now be allowed to delegate youth players from other football clubs. They would also be provided with more youth coaches from the DFV and have the right to accommodate twice as many students in their affiliated Children and Youth Sports Schools (KJS) every year, compared to other football clubs.[1001][999][1002] Union Berlin would now have to delegate some of its best young players to BFC Dynamo.[978][nb 21] One example was the talented Detlef Helms, who was delegated to BFC Dynamo as a 17-year-old in 1977.[65][970]\\n\\nUnion Berlin returned to the Oberliga in the 1976–77 season. Stadion an der Alten Försterei was a small football stadium without cinder tracks where the crowd stood close to the pitch.[762][990] Union Berlin had become the focus of hooligan attention.[719] Matches at the Stadion an der Alten Föresterei had regularly been interrupted by spectators throwing objects on the pitch.[1003] The derby between BFC Dynamo and Union Berlin was now such as heated affair that the matches were moved by the DFV to the neutral Stadion der Weltjugend in Mitte.[1004] It was considered that safety could not be guaranteed with the larger number of spectators.[1005][1006][719][762] The Stadion an der Alten Försterei was known for its atmosphere and the Stadion der Weltjugend was located only a few minutes away from the home district of BFC Dynamo.[990][66] The move was therefore seen as a major disadvantage by the fans to Union Berlin and further diluted their aversion to BFC Dynamo.[45][66][nb 22] Union Berlin defeated BFC Dynamo 1–0 in front of 45,000 spectators at the Stadion der Weltjugend in the first meeting of the 1976–77 season on 4 September 1976.[1008][294][95] Union Berlin also won the return match on 19 February 1977.[95] The two wins against BFC Dynamo during the 1976–77 season cemented the reputation of Union Berlin as a cult club and crowd puller.[1009]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo established itself as one of the top teams in the DDR-Oberliga from the mid-1970s. Union Berlin would come to play second fiddle in East Berlin from now on and never finish higher than seventh place in the DDR-Oberliga.[1010] In the shadow of BFC Dynamo, Union Berlin would no longer have any major sporting significance in East Germany.[1011] Union Berlin became a yo-yo team that hovered between the Oberliga and the DDR-Liga.[1010] Supporters of Union Berlin saw BFC Dynamo as the highest representative of the security organs and the police, with privileges in player recruitment and financial support as well as the political clout of Mielke.[762] This was supposedly in contrast to their own club, which they regarded as an underdog rooted in the working class.[762][719][1012][753] BFC Dynamo would be disliked all over East Germany for its successes and its connection to the Stasi.[910][137][38] This was also reflected in the derby between BFC Dynamo and Union Berlin.[137] The supporters of Union Berlin were seen as oppositional.[137] This is illustrated in the famous sentence of the editor-in-chief of the satirical magazine Eulenspiegel: \\\"Not all Union fans are enemies of the state, but all enemies of the state are Union fans.\\\"[137][1013] But the fact that people supported Union Berlin did not automatically mean that they were against the state.[177] Union Berlin got a lot of sympathy as the weaker club.[177][1014] There was a simple rule in East German football, where the least privileged club got the most sympathy.[178] Supporters of Union Berlin cultivated the image of their club as the eternal underdog.[762][1015]\\n\\nClashes between the supporters of the two teams became increasingly common in the 1970s. Union Berlin had one of the most notorious followings in East Germany at this time.[32] The supporters of Union Berlin often went to away matches in large numbers.[32] Fights were initially won by the supporters of Union Berlin. They were in the clear majority and could chase the supporters of BFC Dynamo from the streets.[972] A punch in the face and a stolen scarf was an experience for many young supporters of BFC Dynamo at this time.[990] But BFC Dynamo gained more and more young supporters with its growing successes in the late 1970s.[174] Many came from working-class families in Prenzlauer Berg.[749] The supporters of BFC Dynamo would eventually begin to appear extremely well organized and by the early 1980s they began to fight back.[972][32] The tide now turned and the supporters of BFC Dynamo would win all fights between the supporters of the two teams from now on.[972][990] Derbies at the Stadion der Weltjugend usually ended with a couple of hundred supporters of BFC Dynamo chasing the supporters of Union Berlin along Chausseestraße down towards the Friedrichsstrasse S-Bahn station.[1016][32][1017] The fights often continued on the side streets of Friedrichstraße.[1017]\\n\\nUnion Berlin is sometimes portrayed as having been an opponent of the East German system and derbies between BFC Dynamo and Union Berlin during the East German era have been hyped as some kind of domestic political showdown.[1018] But Union Berlin was mostly just a club struggling against unfavorable conditions.[1018] The club had become disadvantaged by the state sports politics compared to local rival BFC Dynamo.[1018] Honorary President of Union Berlin Günter Mielis has said: \\\"Union was not a club of resistance fighters, but we had to fight against a lot of political and economic resistance over and over again. We got strength from our fans\\\".[1019] However, Union Berlin would eventually become known for a supporter scene that was anti-establishment, where dissidents could vent their disdain for the system in the anonymity of a crowd.[1010] Supporters of Union Berlin also saw themselves as stubborn and non-conformist, but this image should not be confused with actual resistance.[38] Provocation was part of football in East Germany and people shouted out anything, because it was possible to get away with it.[1020] A critical attitude to the system was something that football supporters across East Germany had in common in the 1970s and 1980s.[1021]\\n\\nSupporters of Union Berlin from the East German era concede that it is an exaggeration to call the club a \\\"resistance club\\\".[1022][970] A supporter of Union Berlin has said: \\\"With the best of intentions, Union fans did not contribute to the overthrow of the GDR. No way, we were interested in football. There is the cliché about the club for the enemies of the state, but that wasn\'t us\\\".[1023] There were no political groups among the supporters of Union Berlin.[1024] For some supporters of Union Berlin, the dissident reputation of Union Berlin is a legend that was created after Die Wende.[1022] A controversy erupted around Union Berlin in 2011 when it became publicly known that the then President of Union Berlin Dirk Zingler had been a member of the Stasi Guards Regiment \\\"Felix E. Dzerzhinsky\\\" for three years during his military service between 1983 and 1986.[1025][1026] Zingler explained that he had sought to spend his military service in Berlin and claimed that he did not know beforehand that the regiment belonged to the Stasi.[1027] However, the Stasi Guards Regiment \\\"Felix E. Dzerzhinsky\\\" was an elite formation; it was not possible to simply apply for the regiment. The Stasi selected who it thought were best fit to serve with the regiment, only accepting recruits that were \\\"loyal to the line\\\".[1027][1028] Zingler had also been a member of the Socialist Unity Party (SED) and leader in the Free German Youth (FDJ) at the time.[1029][1028] Union Berlin Press spokesman Christian Arbeit commented on the reports about Zingler in 2011 saying: \\\"We do have a very unique history, compared to other clubs. But it wasn\'t us that always claimed we were this big anti-Stasi club. These are stories that get simplified in the media.\\\"[1026]\\n\\nMost supporters of Union Berlin were just normal football supporters.[1020] Politics was not in the foreground.[970] Supporters of Union Berlin from the era have testified that their support for the club had nothing to do with politics.[1030] The club was the most important thing and the identification with Union Berlin had primarily to do with Köpenick.[1030][1031] The rivalry was fueled by local pride from the supporters of the two teams.[1032] However, the political dimension was there nonetheless.[1010] BFC Dynamo was supported by the Stasi, who was disliked by many.[1010] But above all, it was the political instrumentalization of football that irritated supporters of Union Berlin.[1033] The political favoritism of BFC Dynamo greatly contributed to the enthusiasm of the supporters of Union Berlin.[972] Supporters of Union Berlin embraced the image of the underdog fighting the odds.[1004] An expression of the supporters of Union Berlin was: \\\"Better to be a loser than a stupid Stasi pig\\\".[1011]\\n\\nThe derby between BFC Dynamo and Union Berlin was first and foremost a local football derby.[1010] Both clubs had supporters who were not loyal to the line.[1024][1034][751] Also supporters of BFC Dynamo were observed by the Stasi during the 1980s.[1035] East Berlin was divided into two: BFC Dynamo was more strongly represented in some parts, and Union Berlin was more strongly represented in other parts.[972] Which team you supported was very much a question of where you lived.[32] BFC Dynamo was the local team if you grew up in Prenzlauer Berg.[1036] And you lived in Mitte, you were also more likely to be a supporter BFC Dynamo, as the home stadium was only a stone\'s throw away along Schönhauser Allee.[32] But Mitte was also a contested area.[759] The border allegedly ran at Alexanderplatz, where many fights between the supporters of the two teams were fought.[972][760] The home districts of the two clubs, Hohenschönhausen and Köpenick respectively, were always dangerous territory for supporters of the other team.[972]\\n\\n\\nBFC Dynamo midfielder Bernd Schulz (right) celebrating together with team captain Frank Rohde (left) after scoring a goal against 1. FC Union Berlin at the Stadion der Weltjugend on 18 March 1989.\\nBFC Dynamo and Union Berlin met a total of 35 times in the DDR-Oberliga and the FDGB-Pokal.

Thom, Frank Pastor and Christian Backs scored two goals each.[1039] The 1980s was a crushing win for BFC Dynamo. Former BFC Dynamo midfielder Falko Götz concluded that: \\\"Union was no opponent to us\\\".[1016] The two teams met 13 times in the Oberliga and FDGB-Pokal during the 1980s. BFC Dynamo won 11 matches and two matches ended in a draw. The matches between the two local rivals were hard-fought on the pitch.[294] Former BFC Dynamo midfielder Frank Terletzki has said that the victories against Union Berlin were always the best.[203] But despite the rivalry between the clubs, it happened that players hung out outside of football.[1040] Former BFC Dynamo defender Frank Rohde has said that players of BFC Dynamo and Union Berlin often gathered to have a beer together after matches.[294]\\n\\nThere were several transfers between the two clubs. BFC Dynamo recruited some of the best players of Union Berlin, such as Reinard Lauck in 1973, Detlef Helms in 1977 and Waldemar Ksienzyk in 1984.[45][970] But there were also transfers in the other direction. Union Berlin predecessor TSC Oberschöneweide recruited Ralf Quest from SC Dynamo Berlin in 1962. Quest scored the winning goal for Union Berlin in the final of the 1967-68 FDGB-Pokal, when the club won a sensational cup victory.[1041] Union Berlin would then recruit several players from BFC Dynamo over the years, such as Werner Heine in 1966, Werner Voigt, Bernd Kempke and Michael Jakob in 1973, Rainer Rohde in 1976, Rainer Wroblewski in 1977, Olaf Seier in 1983, Ralf Sträßer in 1984, Olaf Hirsch in 1986, Norbert Trieloff in 1987, Mario Maek in 1988, and Marco Kostmann and Thomas Grether in 1989, and Bernd Schulz in 1990.[95][970][294][1042] Union Berlin recruited a couple of players from BFC Dynamo in the 1980s who did some of their best seasons at the club.[1043][990] Olaf Seier became the team captain of Union Berlin and Ralf Sträßer became first and only player in Union Berlin to ever become league top goal scorer during the East German era.[65] Mario Maek saved Union Berlin from relegation with a late 3–2 goal against FC Karl-Marx-Stadt in the last match day of the 1987-88 DDR-Oberliga.[970][1044] As many as three former players of BFC Dynamo were involved in the winning goal for Union Berlin.[1044]\\n\\n\\nSupporters of FC Berlin during a match against 1. FC Union Berlin at the Stadion an der Alten Försterei on 23 September 1990.\\nUnion Berlin played in the DDR-Liga in the 1989–90 season. FC Berlin and Union Berlin met in the second round of the 1990-91 FDGB-Pokal at the Stadion an der Alten Försterei on 23 September 1990. It was the first match between the teams since the fall of the Berlin Wall. BFC Dynamo, now named FC Berlin, had now already lost many of its former top-performers to the West German Bundesliga.[1045][809] Union Berlin was now coached by the former BFC Dynamo player and youth coach Werner Voigt.[1046] Hooligans of FC Berlin stormed the home stands armed with clubs and flares and attacked supporters of Union Berlin at the beginning of the match.[263][809] Union Berlin won the match 2–1 on extra-time.[809] It was the first win for Union Berlin against FC Berlin since 1977.[263] Thomas Grether scored the first goal and Olaf Seier scored the winning goal for Union Berlin in the match. Both players had been brought up in the youth department of BFC Dynamo and had played matches for BFC Dynamo in the DDR-Oberliga.[809] Clashes between supporters of the two teams continued in the city after the match. Serious riots broke out in East Berlin, involving hundreds of supporters.[811]\\n\\nFC Berlin and Union Berlin then met in the promotion round to the 2. Bundesliga in the 1990–91 season. FC Berlin lost the first match 1–0 away in the second round at the Stadion an der Alten Försterei on 8 June 1991. Former BFC Dynamo player Bernd Schulz scored the winning goal for Union Berlin.[1047] FC Berlin then defeated Union Berlin 2–0 in the return match in fifth round in front of 9,475 spectators at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark on 18 June 1991. Heiko Bonan and Thorsten Boer scored one goal each in the match.[1048] FC Berlin was only one point behind leader BSG Stahl Brandenburg before the last round. The team managed to defeat Magdeburg 3–5 away on 23 June 1991. However, BSG Stahl Brandenburg defeated Union Berlin 2–0 away. FC Berlin thus finished in second place and missed promotion. Some supporters of BFC Dynamo are convinced that Union Berlin deliberately lost in order to prevent FC Berlin from advancing to the 2. Bundesliga.[257] FC Berlin and Union Berlin then also met in the promotion round for the 2. Bundesliga in 1991–92 season. FC Berlin won the first match 3–0 at home in the third round on 31 May 1992. The team then also won the return match 0–4 away in the fourth round on 7 June 1992.\\n\\nThe two teams met again in the new Regionalliga Nordost that was formed in 1994–95 season. Werner Voigt became the new coach of FC Berlin during the 1995–96 season. Voigt had a long history with BFC Dynamo but also had history with Union Berlin. Voigt had played for Union Berlin between 1973 and 1975 and had coached the team between 1990 and 1992.[1046] FC Berlin under coach Voigt lost 0–6 to 1. FC Union Berlin in the 1996–97 Regionalliga Nordost at the Stadion im Sportforum on 28 September 1996. It was the biggest defeat so far to Union Berlin.[294] Former FC Berlin player Thorsten Boer scored two goals for Union Berlin in the match.[1049] The two teams met 12 times in total in Regionalliga Nordost between 1994 and 2000.

The first match was played at the Stadion an der Alten Försterei on 21 August 2005. BFC Dynamo was missing striker Danny Kukulies and first-choice goalkeeper Nico Thomaschewski before the match. Kukulies was suspended and Thomaschewski injured.[1050][1051] German police and members of the SEK carried out a controversial raid against supporters of BFC Dynamo the night before the match.[440] Club management initially considered withdrawing from the match. The players voted on whether or not to play the match against Union Berlin.[865] More than 1,000 police officers were deployed to the match.[1016] BFC Dynamo eventually lost 8–0.[970] The return match was played at the Stadion im Sportforum on 13 May 2006. The score was 1–1 when around 200 supporters of BFC Dynamo stormed the pitch to attack supporters of Union Berlin.[456][871][873] Supporters of Union Berlin fled the guest block in panic.[872] The match was abandoned and Union Berlin was awarded a 2–0 victory.[871][873] The two teams has not met since then.\\n\\nBFC Dynamo met the reserve team of Union Berlin six times in the NOFV-Oberliga Nord and Regionalliga Nordost between 2010 and 2015.

Journalist Frank Willmann attended the match and claims that the number was rather 30. He also said he did not see any injured police.[1052] There have been several cases of violence between the supporters of the two teams during the 2010s.[1054] Around a hundred hooligans from Union Berlin tried to attack a senior tournament organized by BFC Dynamo in the Dynamo-Sporthalle on 30 January 2010.[1055][1056][1057][875] Also women and children got in the way of the attack.[1057] Around 30 partially masked supporters from Union Berlin attacked players and a small group of supporters of BFC Dynamo in connection with a senior match between Union Berlin and BFC Dynamo at the Sportanlage Hämmerlingstraße in Köpenick on 27 March 2015.[1058][45][1054] One player of BFC Dynamo and two guest spectators were injured.[45] A number of supporters of BFC Dynamo joined Hertha BSC in the guest block of the Stadion an der Alten Försterei during the derby between Union Berlin and Hertha BSC on 2 November 2019.[899]\\n\\nOrganization\\nCurrent board and management\\nAs of 1 August 2023[1059][1060][1061][1062][1063]\\nBerliner Fussball Club Dynamo e.

The U17 team competes in the third tier B-Junior Verbandsliga Berlin and the U19 team competes in second tier A-Junior Regionalliga Nordost.[1094] The youth teams are based in the Sportforum Hohenschönhausen.[637]\\n\\nThere were more than 800 children and youth players in the club as of 2019.[1095] Many children in the club comes from immigrant backgrounds or socially disadvantaged families.[637][1096][626][753][608][634] BFC Dynamo helped football club FC Berlin 23 from neighbouring Storkower Straße in September 2021 and saved more than 40 to 50 children from the club, which was about to be dissolved.[608]\\n\\nThe club launched the so-called \\\"Kita-projekt\\\" in 2003.[637] The Kita-projekt is a day care project that gives boys and girls aged 3 to 6 the opportunity to participate in sports on a regular basis.[637][1097] The Kita-projekt involved approximately 200 children from 16 day care centers in Berlin as of 2020.[1096] The majority of the children come from the localities or former boroughs of Lichtenberg, Hohenschönhausen, Karlshorst, Mitte, Weißensee and Pankow.[1097] The Kita-projekt was the first of its kind in Germany and has received several awards for its work with children.[637][1098][1099] The former professional player of BFC Dynamo Jörn Lenz is the head of the Kita-projekt as of 2021.[1099]\\n\\nThe so-called \\\"Jugendförderverein\\\" was founded in 2004.[426] It is a registered voluntary association that aims to promote youth sports at BFC Dynamo. The Jugendförderverein has supported youth teams with equipment, covered costs for trips to tournaments and helped youth trainers to be able to obtain their trainer license. The Jugendförderverein relies on donations and voluntary work.[1100] Former Club President Mario Weinkauf was one of the seven founding members of the Jugenförderverein and briefly served as chairman of the association before he became club president. Weinkauf had also been a youth trainer in the club for some time.[426]\\n\\nYouth academy during East German era\\nBFC Dynamo had a very successful youth academy during the East German era.[1016][174][201] The youth department had full-time trainers available for all youth classes and access to the best material conditions in the Dynamo-Sportforum.[105][1101] There were no less than 40 full-time trainers in the club.[928] Youth coaches were highly qualified and training in the Children and Youth Sports School (KJS) was extensive.[1102][1103] The youth work at BFC Dynamo during the East German era was described as \\\"absolutely leading\\\" by former coach Jürgen Bogs, who had a background as coach of the junior team.[105][1101] It was also described as \\\"exquisite\\\" by former German sports journalist Horst Friedemann, who worked for Deutsches Sportecho and Kicker.[201]\\n\\nThe upper tier of elite clubs in East Germany had privileged access to talents within designated geographical and administrative areas.[4][1104] All designated football clubs were assigned one or two regional districts in East Germany as catchment areas at their founding in 1965–1966. BFC Dynamo was initially assigned Bezirk Cottbus and one third of the districts in East Berlin.[35][65] The club was later allowed to take over the training centers (German: Trainingszentrum) (TZ) in East Berlin that had previously belonged to the catchment area of FC Vorwärts Berlin, when FC Vorwärts Berlin was relocated to Frankfurt an der Oder before the 1971-72 season.[64][65]\\n\\nHowever, BFC Dynamo, as well as FC Vorwärts Berlin and SG Dynamo Dresden, also had another structural advantage when it came to recruiting talents.[1105] Most sports associations (German: Sportvereinigung) (SV) were dissolved at the founding of the DTSB in 1957.[1106] However, sports associations SV Dynamo and ASV Vorwärts were allowed to continue exist.[1107] A decision in the SED Politburo in 1962 then stipulated that the sports associations SV Dynamo and ASV Vorwärts were allowed to set up sports communities in each location where they operated offices. This meant that SV Dynamo and ASV Vorwärts would be able to run sports communities across the country.[1108] BFC Dynamo would eventually be able recruit talents from the youth departments of all sports communities (German: Sportgemeinschaft) (SG) of SV Dynamo in East Germany, except those in Bezirk Dresden and a number of other sports communities in the southern regional districts that belonged to the catchment area of SG Dynamo Dresden.[105][4][1109][nb 39]\\n\\nThe basis of the East German selection and screening system in competitive sports would eventually consist of special training centers (TZ).[1113][1114][nb 40] SV Dynamo would operate numerous training centers across the whole of East Germany. The training centers were either assigned to BFC Dynamo or SG Dynamo Dresden, depending on catchment area. Training in these training centers were better than elsewhere. The work in the training centers was supervised and directed by BFC Dynamo. The best talents from the individual training centers were then brought together and selected in a multi-day screening session.[69] BFC Dynamo would come to benefit from a nationwide scouting network, which included the partnership with Bezirk Cottbus and 33 training centers (TZ) of SV Dynamo.[1118][1119][68] In total, BFC Dynamo had access to 38 training centers (TZ) across East Germany for the recruitment of talents. As a comparison, Union Berlin had only access to six training centers (TZ), all of which were located in the Berlin area.[70]\\n\\nA number of football clubs became specially promoted focus clubs in the 1970 DFV Football Resolution.[60][999] The focus clubs would receive additional financial support from the DTSB and other advantages.[998][996] In the 1976 DFV Football Resolution, focus clubs were also allowed delegate youth players from other football clubs.[1001] BFC Dynamo became the focus club in East Berlin. As a focus club, BFC Dynamo had the right to delegate 12 students to its affiliated Children and Youth Sports Schools (KJS) every year.[1109][1002] Non-focus football clubs only had the right to delegate six students to their affiliated Children and Youth Sports School (KJS) every year.[1002] The elite Children and Youth Sports School (KJS) \\\"Werner Seelenbinder\\\" provided boarding and schooling for talented players in the Sportforum.[1120][1121][1107] The Children and Youth Sports School (KJS) \\\"Werner Seelenbinder\\\" was affiliated to sports club SC Dynamo Berlin.[1122]\\n\\nThe success of BFC Dynamo during the East German era was based on the club\'s extensive youth work.[1123][1124][105][201] In 1975, there were as many as five national team players in the East Germany junior national football team among the club\'s youth players from the class of 1957.[98]1 Only a fifth of the players who won the ten East German championships with BFC Dynamo were older than 18 years when they joined the club.[990] The youth academy produced stars such as Lutz Eigendorf, Falko Götz and Andreas Thom.[1120][1016][1102][752] Most of the top performers of BFC Dynamo in the 1980s came through the club\'s own youth teams, including Frank Terletzki, Hans-Jürgen Riediger, Norbert Trieloff, Bodo Rudwaleit, Ralf Sträßer, Artur Ullrich, Rainer Ernst, Bernd Schulz, Christian Backs, Frank Rohde, Falko Götz, Jan Voß, Andreas Thom, Jörg Fügner, Hendrik Herzog and Marco Köller.[1125][1126][1127] Several former players of SC Dynamo Berlin and BFC Dynamo became youth trainers in the club after ending their playing careers, such as Herbert Schoen, Hermann Bley, Günter Schröter, Martin Skaba, Peter Rohde, Werner Voigt, Hartmut Pelka and Hans-Jürgen Riediger.[1128][1129][1125][1130][1131]\\n\\nNumerous players from East Germany joined West German clubs at the end of East Germany. Many came from BFC Dynamo. More than 110 players who had been trained in East Germany, primarily in a Children and Youth Sports School (KJS), would go on to play for West German or West Berlin clubs in the Bundesliga after the end of East Germany. German author Michael Peter has created a database for all players who had been trained in East Germany and who played for West German or West Berlin football clubs after 1990. For players born before 1976, BFC Dynamo was the biggest contributor. 98 players, born before 1976, came from the ten designated football clubs and SG Dynamo Dresden. 18 of these, came from BFC Dynamo.[1108]\\n\\nHonours\\nNext Generation Oberliga (German: Nachwuchsoberliga) (de)[a]\\nWinners: 1981, 1991[b]\\nRunners-up (6): 1979, 1983\\nEast German Junior Championship (de)[c]\\nWinners: (5) 1960,[d] 1978, 1979, 1987, 1991\\nRunners-up (6): 1967, 1974, 1976, 1977, 1988, 1989\\nEast German Youth Championship (Youth FDJ-Pokal) (de)[e]\\nWinners: (4) 1967, 1972, 1975, 1987\\nRunners-up: 1983, 1989\\nEast German Junior Cup (Junge Welt-Pokal) (de)[c]\\nWinners: (5) 1966, 1967, 1987, 1989, 1990[b] (record)\\nEast German Youth Cup (Youth FDGB-Pokal)[e]\\nWinners: (5) 1965,[d] 1968, 1971, 1972, 1976 (record)\\n Corresponds to U21 level. The league existed from 1976 to 1983 and 1989 to 1991. The reserve teams of the 14 DDR-Oberliga clubs were no longer allowed to participate in the DDR-Liga after the 1975-76 season. The Junior Oberliga (de) was also disbanded after the season. The Next Generation Oberliga was introduced instead. Youth teams of the 14 DDR-Oberliga clubs were all were eligible to start in the 1976-77 Next Generation Oberliga. Next Generation Oberliga was disbanded after the 1982-83 season. All teams were instead assigned to the third tier Bezirksliga. BFC Dynamo participted in the 1983-84 Bezirksliga Berlin with reseve team BFC Dynamo II. BFC Dynamo II won the 1983-84 Bezirksliga Berlin and qualified for the 1984-85 DDR-Liga A.\\n Won as FC Berlin.\\n Corresponds to U19 level.\\n Won by SC Dynamo Berlin.\\n Corresponds to U17 level.\\nExplanatory notes\\n This was not the first or last relocation or transfer of entire football teams in East Germany at the time. Sports association SV Deutsche Volkpolizei relocated its three second-tier teams SV Deutsche Volkspolizei Potsdam, SV Deutsche Volkspolizei Weimar and SV Deutsche Volkspolizei Schwerin to sports communities in larger cities during the summer of 1952. SV Deutsche Volkspolizei Potsdam was relocated to Berlin, SV Deutsche Volkspolizei Weimar to Erfurt and SV Deutsche Volkspolizei Schwerin to Rostock.[6]The team of SV Vorwärts der KVP Leipzig was relocated to East Berlin in 1953. The team continued the 1953-54 DDR-Oberliga as SV Vorwärts der KVP Berlin. SV Vorwärts der KVP Berlin then became ASK Vorwärts Berlin, which later became FC Vorwärts Berlin.[7][4] The relatively successful team of BSG Empor Lauter and its place in the DDR-Oberliga was transferred to sports club SC Empor Rostock in 1954. The football department of SC Empor Rostock later became F.C. Hansa Rostock.[8] The team of BSG Turbine Halle and its place in the DDR-Oberliga was transferred to sports club SC Chemie Halle-Leuna in 1954.[9] The football department of SC Chemie Halle-Leuna later became Hallescher FC Chemie.\\n SG Dynamo Dresden itself had a background that involved political interference and player delegations. SG Dynamo Dresden was previously known as SV Deutsche Volkspolizei Dresden. When SG Friedrichstadt was dissolved by East German sports authorities after the 1949–50 DDR-Oberliga, the playing right in the DDR-Oberliga was transferred to SV Deutsche Volkspolizei Dresden.[10][8][11] SV Deutsche Volkspolizei Dresden had previously played in the lower-tier Stadtliga Dresden and was thus able to enter the DDR-Oberliga without having to progress through divisions.[12][13] In order to keep the place in the DDR-Oberliga, the team of SV Deutsche Volkspolizei Dresden would be reinforced with players from Volkspolizei teams all over the country.[14] The head of the Volkspolizei Kurt Fischer ordered that best football players in the sports communities of the Volkspolizei around East Germany should be concentrated in the now first-tier SV Deutsche Volkspolizei Dresden.[15] The 40 best players of the various Volkspolizei teams in East Germany were then brought together for a training session in Forst in July 1950. Coaches Fritz Sack and Paul Döring then picked out 17 players from 11 different cities who were delegated to Dresden to form the team.[16][11] SV Deutsche Volkspolizei Potsdam lost its five best players and was severaly weakened.[13][17]\\n However, newspaper Neues Deutschland reported an attendance number of 60,000 spectators.[20]\\n BFC Dynamo played friendly matches against Pogoń Szczecin in 1966, 1969, 1973, two times in 1975, 1977, two times in 1978, 1980, 1984, 1985, 1986 and 1987.[43]\\n SV Dynamo would eventually operate numerous training centers (TZ) across East Germany. The training centers were divided between BFC Dynamo and SG Dynamo Dresden depending on catchment area.[69]\\n German author Steffen Karas also claims in his book \\\"66 Jahre BFC Dynamo - Auswärts mit \'nem Bus\\\" that BFC Dynamo actually only scored nine match-deciding goals in the 86th minute or later, in the 218 matches it won or drew during its ten championship years. Only one of those goals came from a penalty. That penalty was the controversial penalty against 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig in the 1985-86 DDR-Oberliga on 22 March 1986, which was later proven to be correct.[205]\\n Karin Halsch was known as Karin Seidel-Kalmutzki at the time.[339]\\n Sources vary on the history of the stadium. A few sources state that the stadium was constructed in 1954 and then refurbished in 1973.[685][693] A centrally located football stadium is depicted in the early plans for the Dynamo-Sportforum by architects Walter Schmidt and Heinz Scharlipp.[694] Other sources suggest that the stadium was completed in its current form in 1970.[695][688][696]\\n The capacity was 12,000 at the beginning of the 1966–67 season and 14,000 at the beginning of the 1968–69 season.[706][707]\\n The skinhead movement in East Germany grew out of the punk subculture, and was characterized as an aggressive form of protest.[777][778] It was radicalized in the middle of the 1980s, by a hybrid of ultranationalism, xenophobia and anti-communism.[778] East Berlin was the epicenter of the East German skinhead movement, with BFC Dynamo and 1. FC Union Berlin as its two football magnets.[778][779] The Stasi concluded that about 30-40 skinheads were associated to the two clubs in December 1985. Many were attached to fan cub Anale Berlin at BFC Dynamo.[778] Anale Berlin became infamous for its violence capital and glorification of fascism.[778][779] There were around 300–400 skinheads in East Berlin in December 1987.[780][717] Many were fans of BFC Dynamo.[717] Reports noted a group of roughly 100 skinheads that regularly attended the away matches of BFC Dynamo in 1988.[781] And the Stasi estimated that there were about 30 skinheads among the followers of 1. FC Union Berlin in July 1988.[4][781] Despite the fierce rivalry between BFC Dynamo and 1. FC Union Berlin, there were contacts between skinheads of the two clubs.[32] Far-right skinheads were attached to fan clubs Borussen and Die Löwen at 1. FC Union Berlin.[772][782]\\n However, hooligans of BFC Dynamo and skinheads allegedly attached to the hooligan scene of BFC Dynamo were also involved in serious incidents associated with racism and right wing-extremism in the 1980s. Hooligans of BFC Dynamo attacked 26 Cuban guest workers on train D 1056 towards Berlin-Lichtenberg, while returning from a match in Halle on 12 May 1984.[788][789] The hooligans had allegedly shouted racist slogans and sung the Deutschlandlied. At least nine Cubans were injured.[790] A number of skinheads allegedly attached to the hooligan scene of BFC Dynamo were also among those convicted for the much-publicized attack on a punk concert in the Zionskirche church in East Berlin on 17 October 1987.[178][137] However, incidents associated to racism and right-wing extremism in East German football were not isolated to BFC Dynamo and authorities also recorded the use of racists slogans, such as \\\"Jewish pigs!\\\", by supporters of several other teams at the time, including SG Dynamo Dresden and 1. FC Union Berlin.[791][792][793]\\n Several sources claim that a group of 500 hooligans of BFC Dynamo attacked a gas station, looted shops and attacked the Volkspolizei in Jena in November 1989.[32][799][459][788][798] One source specifically claims that the incidents occurred in connection to an away match in the DDR-Oberliga.[799] However, the sources do not specify any exact date or any details regarding which match the incidents occur in connection with. FC Berlin played away against FC Carl Zeiss Jena in the 18th matchday of the 1989-90 DDR-Oberliga on 8 April 1990.\\n Hooligans in Magdeburg attacked Soviet soldiers on 29 August 1990. One officer fired a warning shot.[803] The police fired warning shots during violent riots after the friendly match between 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig and FC Bayern Munich on 6 September 1990.[803][813][815] The match between FC Sachsen Leipzig and FC Carl Zeiss Jena in the 1990-91 NOFV-Oberliga on 29 September 1990 was abandoned shortly before the end due to violent riots in the stadium.[813][814]\\n However, the high number of supporters of FC Berlin at the scene claimed by the police has been disputed.[820] The number of supporters of FC Berlin on the scene varies between different sources. The police initially stated that they had faced up to 500 hooligans.[817][824] However, an eyewitness stated that the group that arrived at the S-Bahn station and marched towards the stadium rather consisted of only 150 supporters. This group was supposedly met by around 50 police officers outside the stadium.[820] Neues Deutschland reported that the number of rioters outside the stadium \\\"grew to around 400 to 500 hooligans\\\".[819] A common figure is that 400 supporters of FC Berlin arrived at the S-Bahn station after kick-off.[823][802][825][264] A supporter of FC Berlin has said in Zeit that there were almost 500 supporters of FC Berlin outside the stadium.[265]\\n Another legend tells that Erich Mielke made a remark about bringing the title to Berlin after the fractious encounter between Dynamo Dresden and BFC Dynamo on 2 December 1978, when he allegedly walked into the locker room of Dynamo Dresden and told the players that \\\"You must understand, the capital city needs a champion!\\\".[923] However, according to another version, he instead made this remark when the players of Dynamo Dresden celebrated their title in 1978 and he allegedly ghosted into their locker room to inform them that BFC Dynamo will be champions next year.[924] And according to yet another version, this happened instead after BFC Dynamo had won its second title in 1980, when Erich Mielke allegedly told the players of Dynamo Dresden that \\\"One must understand, the capital city needs a champion.\\\"[178] Dynamo Dresden was one point ahead of BFC Dynamo before the last match day of the 1979-80 DDR-Oberliga. BFC Dynamo met Dynamo Dresden home in the last matchday on 10 May 1980. BFC Dynamo won the match 1-0 and captured the league title. Dynamo Dresden player Udo Schmuck remembers how Mielke came into the locker room of Dynamo Dresden after the match with a gold medal around his neck. He allegedly said: \\\"It doesn\'t matter. The main thing is that Dynamo is champion!\\\".[925] Mielke is also said to have told Dynamo Dresden player Hans-Jürgen Dörner at the same occasion; \\\"Comrade Dörner, it is clear to all of you that the title belongs in the capital, now it\'s the turn of the BFC.\\\"[926]\\n Former SG Dynamo Dresden coach Klaus Sammer claimed in an interview with Berliner Zeitung in 2003 that with \\\"a few exceptions\\\", SG Dynamo Dresden was only able to fall back on the Bezirk Dresden as catchment area.[929] However, Bezirk Dresden was one of the most populous regional districts in East Germany. East German sports journalist Horst Friedemann claims that the SV Dynamo sports communities (SG) of Eisleben and Halle/Neustadt also belonged to the catchment area of SG Dynamo Dresden. They were located under the \\\"southern line\\\", where Dresden had access.[930] SG Dynamo Dresden also had access to training centers (TZ) of SV Dynamo. SV Dynamo operated numerous training centers across East Germany. The training centers were either assigned to BFC Dynamo or SG Dynamo Dresden, depending on catchment area.[931] In total, SG Dynamo Dresden had 35 partner associations (German: Partnervereine), including training centers (TZ). Their task was mainly to scout the best players and then send them to Dresden.[932] German sports historian Hanns Leske has categorized SG Dynamo Dresden as the third most privileged football club or sports community in East German football, behind FC Vorwärts Berlin and BFC Dynamo.[933]\\n Supporters of 1. FC Union Berlin used the same provocation at away matches in Saxony, despite their cultivation of their club\'s underdog image. A supporter of 1. FC Union Berlin has testified that they brought Cuban organges and rotten bananas to an away match against FC Karl-Marx-Stadt, fully aware that these fruits were symbols of their privileges as East Berliners.[962]\\n BFC Dynamo was officially a club of the Ministry of the Interior.[973] The official sponsor (German: Träger) of the club was the Volkspolizei.[36] The official sponsor of Union Berlin was the state-owned combine VVB Hochspannungsgeräte und Kabel.[974]\\n The football clubs had been assigned one or two districts in East Germany as catchment areas at their founding. 1. FC Union Berlin had been assigned Bezirk Potsdam and one third of all training centers (TZ) in East Berlin. BFC Dynamo had been assigned Bezirk Cottbus and one third of training centers (TZ) in East Berlin. BFC Dynamo now had access to Bezirk Cottbus and two thirds of all training centers (TZ) in East Berlin. 1. FC Union Berlin on the other hand had to make do with its training centers (TZ) in East Berlin.[35][970]\\n FC Vorwärts Berlin was initially a focus club in East Berlin.[1000] The only major club in East Berlin that was never appointed as focus club was 1. FC Union Berlin.[60] FC Vorwärts Berlin continued to be part of the group of focus clubs after its relocation to Frankfurt an der Oder.[1000]\\n Football clubs were given performance assignments from the DTSB that had to be fulfilled. The clubs then had to report on the fulfillment in two-year analyzes. Union Berlin had the objective in 1977-78 of producing four players who could be delegated to the focus club BFC Dynamo. Union Berlin explained that its downward trend in the youth area was due to the fact that the club had to delegate its two best players to the focus club every year and that the club could only rely on four districts in East Berlin for further selection.[978]\\n The club management of 1. FC Union Berlin seriously considered moving all matches to Stadion der Weltjugend after a stormy encounter with BSG Wismut Aue in 1976.[1007]\\n Manfred Kirste was the first president and is the longest serving president. He served as president from 15 January 1966 to 30 August 1988.\\n Served as president until 19 Februari 1990.[1064]\\n Became acting president after the dismissal of Herbert Krafft on 19 February 1990. Bogs served as acting president until 27 May 1990.[1064]\\n Dr. Klaus Janz served as president until 15 October 1990.[1065] He asked to be relieved from the office due to professional stress as a lawyer. He continued as vice president.[1066]\\n Dr. Wolfgang Hösrich became president on 15 October 1990. He had a background as a club doctor for SC Dynamo Berlin and BFC Dynamo. Hösrich had previously served as vice president.[1067][1066] The presidium under Dr. Wolfgang Hösrich was replaced by a new presidium under Eberhard Landmann on 20 May 1994.[1068][1069][1070]\\n Eberhard Landmann became president on 20 May 1994.[1071] Landmann was a former insurance salesman. He only served as president for nine months.[1068][1069][1072]\\n Klaus Bittroff was elected as the new president on 10 February 1995 with the votes 73-11. Volkmar Wanski was elected as one of two vice presidents alongside re-elected Lutz Hoff.[1073][1072][1071] Bittroff had previously served as president of Wacker 04 Berlin from 1984 to 1991.[1071]\\n Became new president after the resignation of Klaus Bittroff on 14 September 1995.[287] Wanski resigned on 29 June 2000.[335][1072][1074]\\n Sports director Hans Reker was appointed acting president by the Economic council following the resignation of Volkmar Wanski on 29 June 2000.[335][1074] Karin Halsch took office as new president on 27 September 2000.[339]\\n Karin Halsch was known as Karin Seidel-Kalmutzki during the era. Served from 27 September 2000 to 25 June 2001.[339][1075]\\n Sports director Hans Reker served as acting president following the resignation of Karin Halsch on 25 June 2001.[1075][356] Hans Reker held the position of vice president in the presidium of Karin Halsch.[1076][346] He resigned together with the entire presidium on 30 October 2001.[376] An emergency board formed by André Sommer, Rayk Bernt and press spokesman Holger Zimmermann took office. The emergency board was meant to serve until the extraordinary general meeting on 26 November 2001.[376][387]\\n An emergency board formed by André Sommer, Rayk Bernt and press spokesman Holger Zimmermann took office on 1 November 2001. No new president was appointed for the transitional board.[376][387] Zimmerman soon resigned on 23 November 2001.[653] A new presidium was due to be elected on the extraordinary general meeting on 26 November 2001. However, the meeting agenda was changed with the votes 87 to 59 at the insistence of the emergency board. The meeting was converted into an information event and new elections were postponed.[653][1077] Club members collected signatures for the election of a new presidium. But the signatures would be ignored by Sommer and Bernt.[388] The Sommer and Bernt presidium was finally overthrown by supporters and the former coach of the women\'s team Volkmar Lucius after an application to the Charlottenburg district court.[388][401] The Charlottenburg district court appointed Lucius as emergency board member.[388] A new presidium was elected on the extraordinary general meeting on 31 May 2002.[1078]\\n Elected on an extraordinary general meeting on 31 May 2002.[1078]\\n Mario Weinkauf was elected president on 18 June 2004.[426] He resigned on a meeting with the presidium on 22 June 2007. He was then dismissed in a vote of no-confidence on an extra-ordinary general meeting on 23 June 2007. Mario Weinkauf was succeeded by Volkmar Wanski as interim president. Volkmar Wanski had been co-opted into the presidium and elected as the provisional successor to Mario Weinkauf on the meeting with the presidium on 22 June 2007. However the interim presidency of Volkmar Wanski was controversial. It was put into question whether his election was compliant with club statutes. Volkmar Wanski resigned after only six days.[1079][1080][1081]\\n Frank Bertron was launched as interim president by the Economic Council under Peter Meyer.[487][1081] He was presented as new president on 28 June 2007.[1081]\\n Norbert Uhlig is the second longest serving president after Manfred Kirste. Norbert Uhlig has been president since 11 October 2008.[1082]\\n German sports historian Hanns Leske writes that BFC Dynamo was able to recruit young players from the youth departments of all sports communities (SG) of SV Dynamo in East Germany, except those in Bezirk Dresden.[1110] German author Anne Hahn writes that the training centers (TZ) of SV Dynamo across East Germany were divided between BFC Dynamo and SG Dynamo Dresden. She writes that the catchment area of BFC Dynamo included the SV Dynamo sports communities (SG) of Rostock-Mitte, Neustrelitz, Fürstenwalde, Schwerin and Berlin. The best talents were brought together in these training centers and then selected in a central, multi-day screening courses.[931] Also Horst Friedemann claims that the catchment area of BFC Dynamo included the SV Dynamo sports communities (SG) of Rostock-Mitte, Neustrelitz, Fürstenwalde and Schwerin. According to Friedemann, the SV Dynamo sports communities (SG) of Eisleben and Halle/Neustadt instead belonged to the catchment area of SG Dynamo Dresden. That was the \\\"southern line\\\", where Dresden had access.[1111][1112]\\n The training centers (TZ) were the first preparatory stage for the support of children found suitable for sports. Training in training centers usually started at the age of 10.[1115] The training course usually lasted for three to four years.[1115] From the training centers, the best young talents could then be delegated to a Children and Youth Sports School (KJS) and a Sports club (SC) or a Football club (FC).[1116][1113][1117]\\nReferences\\nTemplate:Reflist\\n\\nFurther reading\\nTemplate:Cite news\\nBertram, Marco (2015).

V., commonly abbreviated to BFC Dynamo (German pronunciation: [beːʔɛfˌt͡seː dyˈnaːmo] (listen)) or BFC (German pronunciation: [beːʔɛfˈt͡seː] (listen)), alternatively sometimes called Dynamo Berlin, is a German football club based in the locality of Alt-Hohenschönhausen of the borough of Lichtenberg of Berlin. BFC Dynamo was founded in 1966 from the football department of SC Dynamo Berlin and became one of the most successful clubs in East German football. The club is the record champion of East Germany with ten consecutive league championships from 1979 through 1988. BFC Dynamo competes in the fourth tier Regionalliga Nordost. The club enjoys a cross-city rivalry with 1. FC Union Berlin and a historical rivalry with SG Dynamo Dresden. The rivalry with Union Berlin is part of the Berlin derby.\\n\\nHistory\\nBackgrund, founding and rise (1954–1978)\\nMain article: History of Berliner FC Dynamo (1954–1978)\\nBackground: SC Dynamo Berlin (1954–1966)\\nBFC Dynamo started as a football department of sports club SC Dynamo Berlin. SC Dynamo Berlin was founded on 1 October 1954 as one of the new elite sports clubs in East Germany.[2] The sports club was affiliated to sport association SV Dynamo. In order to establish a competitive side in Berlin, the team of SG Dynamo Dresden and its place in the DDR-Oberliga was transferred to the new sports club SC Dynamo Berlin. The relocation was designed to give the capital a team that would rival teams from West Berlin such as Hertha BSC, which were still popular in East Berlin.[3][4][5][nb 1][nb 2]\\n\\n\\nGünter Schröter (left), Horst Kohle of ASK Vorwärts Berlin (centre) and Martin Skaba (right) during a match between Vorwärts Berlin and Dynamo Berlin at the Walther-Ulbricht-Stadion on 18 October 1959\\nThe team played its first match as SC Dynamo Berlin against BSG Rotation Babelsberg in the 1954-55 DDR-Oberliga on 21 November 1954. Among the players delegated from SG Dynamo Dresden were Johannes Matzen, Herbert Schoen and Günter Schröter. SC Dynamo Berlin finished its first season in the DDR-Oberliga in seventh place. The team was relatively successful in the 1955 DDR-Oberliga, but suffered relegation to the second tier DDR-Liga after the 1956 DDR-Oberliga. SC Dynamo Berlin played a friendly match against Polish side Górniczy KS Szombierki Bytom in front of 80,000 spectators at the Walter-Ulricht-Stadion on 9 May 1957.[18][19] The attendance number is allegedly the highest in the history of the club.[19][nb 3] SC Dynamo Berlin eventually finished the 1957 DDR-Liga in first place immediately returned to the DDR-Oberliga.\\n\\nGünter Schröter and Herbert Maschke would remain central players to the team into early the 1960s. But most other players of the former SG Dynamo Dresden team were no longer active in the team by the late 1950s.[21] Herbert Schoen had played his last competitive matches for the team during the 1957 season and Johannes Matzen had suffered a serious injury during the 1958 season and consequently had to end his playing career.[22] The team was now instead shaped by a new generation of players, including Martin Skaba, Werner Heine, Waldemar Mühlbächer, Hermann Bley and Konrad Dorner (de).[23]\\n\\n\\nThe team of SC Dynamo Berlin after winning the 1959 FDGB-Pokal, at the Bruno-Plache-Stadion in Leipzig on 13 December 1959\\nSC Dynamo Berlin had difficulties establishing itself in football in East Berlin.[17] The team rarely drawing crowds larger than 5,000 spectators at the Walter-Ulbricht-Stadion. SC Dynamo Berlin finally won its first trophy in the 1959 FDGB-Pokal. However, the team would not be allowed to participate in the 1960-61 European Cup Winners\' Cup. The East German Football Association (DFV) found local rival and league runner-up ASK Vorwärts Berlin to be a more suitable representative of East Germany in the competition.[24]\\n\\nSC Dynamo Berlin also had some success in the first seasons of the 1960s. The team fished the 1960 DDR-Oberliga as runner-up. SC Dynamo Berlin was a top team also in the 1961-62 DDR-Oberliga. The team participated in the 1961–62 International Football Cup during the summer of 1961. SC Dynamo Berlin was successful in 1961-62 FDGB-Pokal. The team was only defeated 1-3 by SC Chemie Halle in the final.[25] However, SC Dynamo Berlin still found itself overshadowed in the capital by the army-sponsored ASK Vorwärts Berlin.[26] The team of SC Dynamo Berlin during the 1960s would eventually prove relatively weak.[27] SC Dynamo Berlin had become a lower table side by the end of the 1962–63 Oberliga.[21]\\n\\nEast German football was reformed in 1965–66, when the football departments of ten sports clubs (SC) were made independent from their sports clubs to form ten dedicated football clubs. The new designated football clubs (FC) would form the elite of East German football. As part of the reorganization, the football section of SC Dynamo Berlin was separated from the sports club and reorganized as football club BFC Dynamo.[28][29][4][30] The football department of sports community SG Dynamo Hohenschönhausen was also disbanded after the 1965–66 season. The players of SG Dynamo Hochenschönhausen joined the reserve team BFC Dynamo II and BFC Dynamo II took over the place of SG Dynamo Hohenschönhausen in the 1966-67 Bezirksliga Berlin.\\n\\nFounding and second relegation (1966–1967)\\nBFC Dynamo was founded on 15 January 1966.[31] The new club was presented by the President of SV Dynamo Erich Mielke at a ceremony in the Dynamo-Sporthalle in Hohenschönhausen in East Berlin.[32] The first presidium included the Head of the Volkspolizei in East Berlin Horst Ende, the Intendant of the Metropol theatre Hans Pitra, former DDR-Oberliga player Johannes Matzen and the Editor-in-chief of the East German football weekly Die Neue Fußballwoche (FuWo) (de) Klaus Schlegel.[33] Manfred Kirste was elected club president and Mielke was elected honorary president.[32][31] Kirste came from Berlin and was a certified sports teacher.[34]\\n\\n\\nThe match between BFC Dynamo and FC Vorwärts Berlin in the DDR-Oberliga at the Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum on 13 August 1966\\nThe new designated football clubs (FC) were formed as centers of excellence in East German football, with the right to draw on talents within designated geographical and administrative areas.[4][29] BFC Dynamo was initiallly assigned Bezirk Cottbus and one third of East Berlin as catchment area.[35] BFC Dynamo was officially a club of the Ministry of the Interior, and the club\'s official sponsor was the Volkspolizei.[36][37] However, the honorary chairman Mielke was the head of the Stasi and most of the club\'s sponsoring members would eventually be made up of Stasi employees. BFC Dynamo would come to receive personal, organizational and financial support from the Stasi.[37][38] Research by the Stasi Records Agency has shown that 31 employees of the Ministry of the Interior and ten employees of the Stasi would eventually be involved in the club.[39]\\n\\nSC Dynamo Berlin had been in first place in the 1965-66 DDR-Oberliga after the eighth matchday.[40] BFC Dynamo were still in a good fourth place after a 2–0 win over BSG Chemie Leipzig on the 23rd matchday on 16 April 1966. However, the team then lost its last three matches in the league, against F.C. Hansa Rostock, SG Dynamo Dresden and FC Rot-Weiß Erfurt, and finished the season in ninth place.[41]\\n\\nHungarian Bela Volentik was new coach for the 1966–67 season. The team played a friendly match against Polish side Pogoń Szczecin on 10 September 1966. The match would be one of many in a long series of friendly maches against Pogoń Szczecin during the East German era.[42][nb 4] The team struggled in the 1966-67 DDR-Oberliga. BFC Dynamo faced local rivals 1. FC Union Berlin away on the 22nd matchday on 26 April 1967. BFC Dynamo was in 13th place in the league and threatened with relegation.[44][45] Supporters of 1. FC Union Berlin mocked the team with a banner saying \\\"We greet the relegated\\\". 1. FC Union Berlin won the match 3-0 and BFC Dynamo was now practically relegated.[45] The match is seen as the starting point for the feud between the two clubs.[45] BFC Dynamo eventually finished the 1966-67 DDR-Oberliga in 13th place and was again relegated to the DDR-Liga. Long-time player Waldemar Mühlbächer retired from his playing career after the season.[46] Mühlbächer had joined SC Dynamo Berlin in 1956 and had played 11 seasons for the team.[47]\\n\\nRejuvenation and first UEFA competition (1967–1972)\\nFormer SC Dynamo Berlin forward Karl Schäffner returned as coach for the 1967–68 season.[48] BFC Dynamo dominated the 1967-68 DDR-Liga Nord. The team was undefeated during the second half of the league season and immediately won promotion back to the DDR-Oberliga.[49] Forward Peter Lyszczan became tied league top goalscorer in the 1967-68 DDR-Liga Nord with 19 goals.[50] Martin Skaba and Hermann Bley retired after the 1967–68 season and Konrad Dorner was transferred to the reserve team BFC Dynamo II.[51] The three had joined SC Dynamo Berlin between 1956 and 1958. Skaba had played in a total of 343 matches for the team.[52]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo began a rejuvenation of the team during the 1967–68 season.[51] Among the players from the youth department who got to play matches in the 1967-68 DDR-Liga Nord were Harald Schütze (de), Norbert Johannsen and Werner Voigt.[53] BFC Dynamo fielded a young team in the 1968–69 season. The average age of the team was 23 years at the start of the season.[54] Harald Schütze was now a regular player in the team.[51] BFC Dynamo got off to a difficult start on its return to the DDR-Oberliga. Hans Geitel took over as coach for the second half of the season. Geitel had previously worked in the youth academy of BFC Dynamo.[55] The team finished the 1968-69 DDR-Oberliga in tenth place.\\n\\nBFC Dynamo recruited young forward Ralf Schulenberg from FC Rot-Weiß Erfurt for the 1969–70 season.[56] Schulenberg was probably compensation for the talented Günter Wolff, who had left BFC Dynamo for FC Rot-Weiß Erfurt after the 1967–68 season.[55] A number of players from the youth departments would also make their debut in the DDR-Oberliga in the following seasons, such as Peter Rohde (de) in 1969, Frank Terletzki in 1969 and Bernd Brillat in 1970. BFC Dynamo reached the final of the 1970-71 FDGB-Pokal. The team lost the final 1–2 in overtime to SG Dynamo Dresden, but qualified for the next season\'s UEFA Cup Winners\' Cup as runner-up.[57] This time, the team would also be allowed to participate in the competition, unlike in 1960. BFC Dynamo was thus finally ready for its first participation in an UEFA competition.[58]\\n\\nA number of football clubs became specially promoted focus clubs (German: Schwerpunktclubs) in the 1970 DFV Football Resolution (German: DFV-Fußballbeschluss).[59][60] BFC Dynamo and FC Vorwärts Berlin became focus clubs in East Berlin.[60][61] The football landscape in East Berlin would then change dramatically ahead of the 1971–72 season, when the Ministry of Defense decided to relocate FC Vortwärts Berlin to Frankfurt an der Oder.[62][63] BFC Dynamo and 1. FC Union Berlin were from now on the only major football clubs in East Berlin.[64] BFC Dynamo would be allowed to take over the catchment area in East Berlin that had previously belonged to FC Vorwärts Berlin.[65][64] The team would also have the opportunity to play more matches at the larger and more centrally located Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark in Prenzlauer Berg, which led to increased interest in the club and growing attendance numbers.[66]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo stood out among other teams within SV Dynamo. BFC Dynamo was located at the frontline of the Cold War. It was also a representative of the East German capital. This meant that the club had to be well equipped.[67] BFC Dynamo would eventually get access to a nationwide scouting network, including numerous training centers (German: Trainingszentrum) (TZ) of SV Dynamo across East Germany.[68][nb 5] BFC Dynamo would eventually be able to recruit young talented players from 38 training centers (TZ) across East Germany. By comparison, 1. FC Union Berlin only had access to 6 training centers (TZ), all of which were located in the Berlin area.[70]\\n\\nThe team was joined by forward Wolf-Rüdiger Netz from SG Dynamo Schwerin for the 1971–72 season. Among the central players in the team in the 1971–72 season were Werner Lihsa, Harald Schütze, Frank Terletzki, Dieter Stumpf, Norbert Johannsen, Peter Rohde, Wilfried Trümpler, Joachen Carow, Wolf-Rüdiger Netz and Ralf Schulenberg.[71] BFC Dynamo had success in the 1971–72 UEFA Cup Winners\' Cup. The team eliminated Cardiff City F.C. in the first round and then K Beerschot VA in the second round. BFC Dynamo would now also show its strength in the DDR-Oberliga. The team was unbeaten in the first six league matches after the winter break, including wins against top teams 1. FC Magdeburg and SG Dynamo Dresden.[72] The team eliminated Åtvidabergs FF in the quarter-finals of the 1971–72 UEFA Cup Winners\' Cup and advanced to the semi-finals.[73] BFC Dynamo thus became the first team from Berlin to reach the semi-finals in one of the two most prestigious UEFA competitions (the European Cup and the European Cup Winners\' Cup). BFC Dynamo was eventually eliminated by Dynamo Moscow in the semi-finals after a penalty shoot-out at the Druzhba Stadium in Lviv in the return leg on 20 April 1972.[74] The team finished the 1971-72 DDR-Oberliga as runner-up.\\n\\nRise in the DDR-Oberliga (1972–1978)\\nBFC Dynamo was qualified for the 1972-73 UEFA Cup. The team eliminated Angers SCO and Levski Sofia in the first two rounds. BFC Dynamo was then set to play Liverpool F.C. in the third round. The first leg ended 0–0 in front of 20,000 spectators at the Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum on 29 November 1972.[75] The team was eventually eliminated after a 1–3 defeat at Anfield on 13 December 1972. BFC Dynamo saw a decline in the league and finished 1972-73 DDR-Oberliga in sixth place. The talented 17-year-old forward Hans-Jürgen Riediger from the youth department made his debut for BFC Dynamo in the DDR-Oberliga at the end of the 1972–73 season.[76]\\n\\n\\nThe match between BFC Dynamo and F.C. Hansa Rostock at the Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum on 28 September 1974.\\nHarry Nippert became the new coach for the 1973–74 season.[77] Günter Schröter became his assistant.[78] Nippert had once played for SC Dynamo Berlin.[79] He had recently served as assistant to famous SG Dynamo Dresden coach Walter Fritzsch from 1969 to 1973.[80] BFC Dynamo recruited attacking midfielder and national team player Reinhard Lauck from relegated 1. FC Union Berlin for of the 1973–74 season.[78] Numerous players were tried during the season. Not a single player played all 26 league matches during the 1973–74 season.[81] The team finished also the 1973-74 DDR-Oberliga in sixth place. Martin Skaba became the new assistant coach for the 1974–75 season.[82] BFC Dynamo recruited young defender Michael Noack (de) from relegated BSG Energie Cottbus for the season.[82] League results improved and BFC Dynamo finished the 1974-75 DDR-Oberliga in fourth place. Several players from the youth department made their debuts for BFC Dynamo in DDR-Oberliga during the 1974–75 season: Lutz Eigendorf, Roland Jüngling (de) and Norbert Trieloff.[83][84][85]\\n\\n\\nHans-Jürgen Riediger in the match between BFC Dynamo and 1. FC Magdeburg at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark on 6 March 1976.\\nBFC Dynamo moved is home matches to the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark for the 1975–76 season.[86] Frank Terletzki became the new team captain for the season.[83] BFC Dynamo had the youngest team in the league in the 1975-76 DDR-Oberliga, with an average age of only 22.5 years.[87][83] BFC Dynamo was now again on the rise in the DDR-Oberliga. The team would eventually establish itself as a top team in the DDR-Oberliga in the mid-1970s. BFC Dynamo recorded several big wins and attendance numbers at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark in the 1975-76 DDR-Oberliga, such as 4–0 against second-placed 1. FC Magdeburg in front of 22,000 spectators on 6 March 1976, 3–0 against FC Carl Zeiss Jena in front of 23,000 spectators on 14 April 1976 and then 6–0 against third-placed 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig in front of 25,000 spectators on 8 May 1976.[88][89][90][91][92] The team finished the 1975-76 DDR-Oberliga as runner-up. The young team under Nippert achieved a goal difference of 67–24 in the 1975-76 DDR-Oberliga.[17]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo recruited young defender Rainer Troppa from relegated BSG Energie Cottbus for the 1976–77 season.[93] The team lost 0–1 to local rivals 1. FC Union Berlin in the opening match of the 1976-77 DDR-Oberliga in front of 45,000 spectators at the Stadion der Weltjugend on 4 September 1976.[94][95] BFC Dynamo was qualified for the 1976–77 UEFA Cup. The team was eliminated in the first round by Shakhtar Donetsk. Goalkeeper Bodo Rudwaleit and forward Ralf Sträßer from the youth department made their debuts for BFC Dynamo in the DDR-Oberliga during the first half of the 1976–77 season.[96][97] The return match against 1. FC Union Berlin in the 1976-77 DDR-Oberliga was played on 19 February 1977. The return match saw Peter Rohde play against his younger brother Rainer Rohde. Rainer Rohde, a former BFC Dynamo player for ten years, had been transferred to 1. FC Union Berlin in 1976. Their younger brother Frank Rohde, a youth player at BFC Dynamo, was one of the 28,000 spectators at the Stadion der Weltjugend. BFC Dynamo lost also the return match 0–1. However, the loss in the return match in the 1976-77 DDR-Oberliga would be the last ever defeat against 1. FC Union Berlin in the DDR-Oberliga.[95] BFC Dynamo came back with a 6–0 win over F.C. Hansa Rostock on the following matchday on 26 February 1977. Wolf-Rüdiger Netz scored a legendary hat-trick in the match, with three goals in the 63rd, 64th and 66th match minutes.[98]\\n\\n30-year-old Jürgen Bogs became the new coach for the 1977–78 season.[99][100][101] Bogs had a background as a youth coach in the club.

The team made it all the way to the quarter-finals of the 1979–80 European Cup, where it faced Nottingham Forest under Brian Clough. The team won the first leg 0–1 away. BFC Dynamo thus became the first German team to defeat an English team in England in the European Cup.[121] The winning goal was scored by Hans-Jürgen Riediger. However, the team lost the return leg 0-2 and was eliminated on goal difference. BFC Dynamo was one point behind leading SG Dynamo Dresden heading into the final matchday of the 1979-80 DDR-Oberliga.[122] The team defeated SG Dynamo Dresden 1–0 in the final matchday in front of 30,000 spectators at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark and won its second consecutive league title. The winning goal was scored by Norbert Trieloff.[123][124]\\n\\nThe East Germany national football team won silver medal at the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow. BFC Dynamo was represented by five players in the squad: Bodo Rudwaleit, Artur Ullrich, Norbert Trieloff, Frank Terletzki and Wolf-Rüdiger Netz. All five played in the final against Czechoslovakia at the Central Lenin Stadion on 2 August 1980.[125] Joachim Hall (de) became the new assistant coach for the 1980–81 season.[126] Hall had played for SC Dynamo Berlin and BFC Dynamo between 1963 and 1972. Also the 1980-81 DDR-Oberliga was a tight race. BFC Dynamo was in first place heading into the final matchday, with the same number of points as second-placed FC Carl Zeiss Jena.[127] BFC Dynamo defeated FC Carl Zeiss Jena 2–1 in the final match day and won its third consecutive league title.[128] Even more players from the youth department had been integrated into the first team over the last seasons, such as Rainer Ernst in 1979, Bernd Schulz in 1979, Olaf Seier in 1979, Frank Rohde in 1980, Falko Götz in 1980 and Christian Backs in 1981.\\n\\nBFC Dynamo was drawn against AS Saint-Étienne in the first round of the 1981-82 European Cup.

FC Magdeburg 4–0 on the 23rd matchday of the 1981-82 DDR-Oberliga in front of 18,000 spectators at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark on 8 May 1982.[133] Supporters of BFC Dynamo invaded the pitch of the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark in celebration of the league title. It was the first pitch invasion by the supporters of BFC Dynamo in the DDR-Oberliga.[134]\\n\\nDominance in the DDR-Oberliga (1982–1986)\\n\\nHans-Jürgen Riediger and defending Holger Hieronymus of Hamburger SV in the 1982-83 European Cup at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark on 15 September 1982.\\nBFC Dynamo was drawn against West German champions Hamburger SV in the first round of the 1982-83 European Cup. The Stasi feated riots, political demonstrations and supporters who might express sympathy for West German stars such as Felix Magath. Only 2,000 tickets were allowed for ordinary fans. The rest was instead allocated to a politically hand-picked audience.[135][136][137] The first leg ended 1–1 in front of 22,000 spectators at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark. Hans-Jürgen Riedier scored the only goal for BFC Dynamo in the match. BFC Dynamo was eventually eliminated after a 2–0 defeat at the Volksparkstadion in the return leg. BFC Dynamo now dominated the DDR-Oberliga. The team went through the entire 1982-83 DDR-Oberliga undefeated. BFC Dynamo was eventually defeated 1-2 by FC Karl-Marx-Stadt on the seventh matchday of the 1983-84 DDR-Oberliga on 1 October 1983. It was the first loss since the 22nd matchday of the 1981-82 DDR-Oberliga. BFC Dynamo had thus been undefeated in 36 matches in the league, which set a new record in the DDR-Oberliga for the longest unbeaten run.[138][139]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo was drawn against FK Partizan Belgrade in the second round of the 1983-84 European Cup. The team won the first leg 2–0 at home. The team flew to Belgrade with Erich Mielke\'s service aeroplane on 1 November 1983 for the return leg.[140] During a shopping trip in Belgrade the day before the match, players Falko Götz and Dirk Schlegel (de) defected to West Germany.[140][141] The talented 18-year old forward Andreas Thom from the youth department was given the chance to make his international debut in the match as a replacement for Falko Götz. Thom had only played 5 minutes in the DDR-Oberliga before that.[142] Thom made a terrific international debut and would henceforth be a regular player in the team.[141][143][144] The match ended 1-1 and BFC Dynamo advanced to the quarter-finals. BFC Dynamo was drawn against AS Roma in the quarter-finals of the 1983-84 European Cup.

It was the fourth time in five seasons that BFC Dynamo had been eliminated in the European Cup by an eventual finalist. Three times had BFC Dynamo been eliminated by the team that eventually won the tournament: Nottingham Forrest in the 1979-80 season, Aston Villa in the 1981-82 season and Hamburger SV in the 1982-83 season.\\n\\nBFC Dynamo capured its sixth consecutive league title on the 25th matchday of the 1983-84 DDR-Oberliga.[147] Rainer Ernst became the best goal scorer in the 1983-48 DDR-Oberliga with 20 goals.[148] Several players from the youth department made their debuts for BFC Dynamo in the DDR-Oberliga during the 1983–84 season, such as Andreas Thom, Thomas Grether, Mario Maek and Eike Küttner.[149] BFC Dynamo reached the final of the 1983-84 FDGB-Pokal. The team once again faced SG Dynamo Dresden in the final. BFC Dynamo lost the final 1–2.[150] Hans-Jürgen Riediger and Michael Noack ended their careers due to prolonged injuries after the season. Wolf-Rüdiger Netz retired and Ralf Sträßer left for 1. FC Union Berlin.[151] Riediger, Noack and Netz had all played around 200 matches each for BFC Dynamo in the DDR-Oberliga.[152][153][154] Riediger and Netz had also scored more than 100 goals each for BFC Dynamo in the DDR-Oberliga.[153][154]\\n\\n\\nThe team of BFC Dynamo celebrating its seventh consecutive DDR-Oberliga title at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark on 1 June 1985.\\nBFC Dynamo recruited striker Frank Pastor from relegated HFC Chemie and defender Waldemar Ksienzyk from relegated 1.

Goalkeeper Bodo Rudwaleit saved the last two penalty kicks for Aberdeen FC.[158][159][157] BFC Dynamo was neck-to-neck with SG Dynamo Dresden in the first half of the 1984-85 DDR-Oberliga. BFC Dynamo eventually finished the 1984-85 DDR-Oberliga in first place, six points ahead of SG Dynamo Dresden, and won its seventh consecutive league title. The team had scored a total of 90 goals during the league season, which set a new record for the number of goals in one DDR-Oberliga season.[160] No team would ever score more goals in one season in the DDR-Oberliga. Rainer Ernst was once again the best goal scorer in the league with 24 goals. Frank Pastor was the second best goal scorer in the league with 22 goals.[161] BFC Dynamo reached the final of the FDGB-Pokal for a second consecutive season and once again faced rival SG Dynamo Dresden in the final. BFC Dynamo lost the final of the 1984-85 FDGB-Pokal 2–3.[162]\\n\\n\\nThe match between 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig and BFC Dynamo on 22 March 1986.\\nBFC Dynamo was already eliminated in the first round of the 1985-86 European Cup by Austria Wien. The team faced stiff competition from SG Dynamo Dresden during the first half of the 1985-86 DDR-Oberliga. Youg defender Jörg Fügner from the youth departent made his debut for BFC Dynamo in the DDR-Oberliga towards the end of the first half of the season.[163] BFC Dynamo was in first place in the league before the winter break.[164] The team faced fourth-placed 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig on the 18th matchday. 1. FC Lokomotiv Leipzig led the match 1–0 in overtime. BFC Dynamo was then awarded a penalty in the 94th minute.[165] Frank Pastor safely converted the penalty and the match ended in a 1–1 draw.[166] The penalty was highly controversial and would later become known as the \\\"Shame penalty of Leipzig\\\".[167] BFC Dynamo also faced 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig in the two-legged semi-finals of the 1985-86 FDGB-Pokal. BFC Dynamo was eliminated on the away goals rule. 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig had scored a total of three goals on penalties in the semi-finals.[168][169] BFC Dynamo managed to secure its eighth consecutive league title on the final matchday of the 1985-86 DDR-Oberliga.[170][171] The team finished just two points ahead of runners-up 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig. Long time-player Frank Terletzki retired from his playing career after the season. Terletzki had played in a total of 489 matches for BFC Dynamo since 1969.[172]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo had the best material conditions in the league and the best team by far.[173] But controversial refereeing decisions in favor of BFC Dynamo gave rise to speculation that the dominance of BFC Dynamo was not solely due to athletic performance, but also due to help from referees.[174] BFC Dynamo was a representative of both the Stasi and the capital. The team was therefore viewed with more suspicion than affection.[175][174] The overbearing success of BFC Dynamo in the 1980s made fans of opposing teams easily aroused as to what they saw as manipulation by bent referees.[173][176] The team was met with aggression and shouts such as \\\"Bent champions!\\\" (German: Schiebermeister) and \\\"Jews Berlin!\\\" at away matches.[177][4][178][179] Complaints of alleged referee bias accumulated.[173][4][180] The German Football Association of the GDR (DFV) eventually conducted a secret review of the 1984-85 DDR-Oberliga.[173][167][181] Among other things, the review found that BFC Dynamo had earned only one third of the yellow cards incurred by rival SG Dynamo Dresden.[182][183][181] A review was also made of the final of the 1984-85 FDGB-Pokal final between BFC Dynamo and SG Dynamo Dresden. This review found that 30 percent of the referee decisions were wrong, and that 80 percent of those had been of disadvantage to SG Dynamo Dresden.[184][185][186][181] A number of referees were sanctioned for their performances in matches involving BFC Dynamo in the following months, including the referees involved in the cup final.[4][186][181]\\n\\nA particularly controversial episode was the penalty awarded to BFC Dynamo by referee Bernd Stumpf in extra time in the match between 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig and BFC Dynamo on 22 March 1986. The penalty caused a wave of protests.[167][187][174] SED General Secretary Erich Honecker and Secretary for Security, Youth and Sport of the SED Central Committee Egon Krenz were fed up with the \\\"football question\\\" and the \\\"BFC-discussion\\\".[167] An example was consequently made out of referee Stumpf. He was permanently banned from refereeing by the DFV.[165] The sanctions against Stumpf were approved by Honecker and Krenz in the SED Central Committee.[188][189] However, a previously unknown video recording of the match was published by Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk (MDR) in 2000. The video recording showed that the penalty was correctly awarded and that the sanctions against Stumpf were unjustified.[165][178][190]\\n\\n\\\"I can imagine there was referee manipulation due to the immense pressure from the government and Ministry for State Security. That could have made some referees nervous and influenced their decisions. But we were the strongest team at the time. We didn\'t need their help.\\\"\\n\\nFalko Götz[191]\\nThe benefit of controlling important matches in Western Europe might have put indirect pressure on the referees to take preventive measures, in so-called preventive obedience.[192][193][194][195][175] In order pursue an international career, a referee would need a travel permit, confirmed by the Stasi.[188][181][196] It become known after the German reunification that several referees had also been Unofficial collaborators (IM) of the Stasi.[167][197][198][199] However, there is no evidence to show that referees were under direct instructions from the Stasi and no document has ever been found in the archives that gave the Stasi a mandate to bribe referees.[197][194][200][201]\\n\\nThe picture that the success of BFC Dynamo relied upon referee bias is dismissed by former BFC Dynamo players and coaches. Some of them admit that there might have been cases of referee bias, but they all insist that it was the thoroughness of their youth work and the quality of their play that earned them their titles.[202][174][191][203] Former coach Jürgen Bogs has said: \\\"You cannot postpone 26 matches in one season in the DDR-Oberliga. At that time we had the best football team\\\".[204][190][nb 6] BFC Dynamo was able to filter the best talents through nationwide screening and train them in its youth academy. The youth academy had full-time trainers employed for every age group.[206] As a trainer of the DDR-Oberliga team, Bogs worked with modern training methods, such as video evalutations, which was not yet common in East Germany. The club also applied heart rate and lactate measurements during training, which only came to the Bundesliga many years later.[207][190] Former referee Bernd Heynemann has concluded: \\\"The BFC is not ten times champions because the referees only whistled for Dynamo. They were already strong as a bear.\\\"[208]\\n\\nLast titles in East Germany (1986–1989)\\n\\nMarco Köller (left) and Heiko Scholz of 1.

Hansa Rostock for of the 1986–87 season.[209] Doll and Andreas Thom would form one of the most effective attacking duos in East German football in the late 1980s. BFC Dynamo defeated 1. FC Union Berlin 8–1 in the derby on the fourth matchday of the 1986-87 DDR-Oberliga.[210][211] The East Germany U19 team won the 1986 UEFA European Under-18 Championship, after defeating Italy 3–1 in the final on 15 October 1986. BFC Dynamo was represented by two youth players in the squad: midfielder Marco Köller and defender Hendrik Herzog.[212] [213] Köller and Herzog would then make their debuts for BFC Dynamo in the DDR-Oberliga during the 1986–87 season.[214][215] The team met fierce competition from 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig in the 1986–87 DDR-Oberliga. BFC Dynamo met 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig away on the 20th matchday at the Bruno-Plache-Stadion on 11 April 1987.[216] The two teams had the same number of points going into the match.[217] BFC Dynamo won the match 1–3.[216] The team eventually finished the 1986-87 DDR-Oberliga in first place, 6 points ahead of runner-up SG Dynamo Dresden and 8 points ahead of third-placed 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig.[218]\\n\\n\\nAndreas Thom during a match against SG Dynamo Dresden on 6 April 1988.\\nBFC Dynamo was eliminated in the first round of the 1987-88 European Cup after double defeats against FC Girondins de Bordeaux. Also the 1987-88 DDR-Oberliga meant firece competition from 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig. BFC Dynamo finished the first half of the season as Herbstmeister. The team had the same number of points as second-placed 1. FC Lokomotiv Leipzig and led the league only on goal difference.[219] Andreas Thom was the top scorer in the league by a wide margin, with 14 goals in 13 games in the first half of the season.[220] The second half of the 1987-88 DDR-Oberliga was a tight race against 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig until the end. BFC Dynamo and 1. FC Lokomotive were level on points heading into the final matchday, but BFC Dynamo had the better goal difference.[221] BFC Dynamo defeated FC Vorwärts Frankfurt 1–0 at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark on the final matchday and won its tenth consecutive DDR-Oberliga title. The winning goal was scored by Burkhard Reich.[222] The team then defeated FC Carl Zeiss Jena 2–0 in front of 40,000 spectators at the Stadion der Weltjugend in the final of the 1987–88 FDGB-Pokal and finally completed the Double.[223] Andreas Thom was eventually voted the 1988 East German footballer of the year.[224]\\n\\n\\nAndreas Thom receiving the 1988 East German footballer of the year award from the Die Neue Fußballwoche (de) editor-in-chief Jürgen Nöldner on 13 August 1988.\\nLong-time club president Manfred Kirste was replaced by Herbert Krafft ahead of the 1988–89 season.[225] Krafft had a background in the Volkspolizei.[226] BFC Dynamo was drawn against West German champions SV Werder Bremen in the first round of the 1988-89 European Cup. The first match was played at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark. Among the spectators was the former West German Chancellor Willy Brandt. BFC Dynamo sensationally won the match 3–0.[227] Bodo Rudwaleit was a match hero, with numerous saves.[228] However, the team lost the return leg at the Weser-Stadion with 5–0. The return leg in Bremen would become known as the second \\\"Miracle on the Weser\\\".[228][227] It has been rumored that the spectacular loss in the return leg was explained by BFC Dynamo having been given doping before the home game in East Berlin.[105][229] A more likely explanation, however, is that the players could not cope with the enormous pressure before the return leg.[229] It has also been rumored that the players were distracted from their pre-match preparations by shopping opportunities, which had been arranged by SV Werder Bremen manager Willi Lemke.[229][230] BFC Dynamo lost important points to its league rivals in the autumn and finished the first half of the season in fourth place, a full nine points behind SG Dynamo Dresden. It was the team\'s worst result after a first half of the season in the league in 14 years.[231]\\n\\nAverage attendance had dropped from 15,000 to 9,000 during the team\'s most successful years in the 1980s.[173] Ordinary fans feared the Stasi and had become disillusioned with political interference. Particularly aggravating were the restrictions on ticket sales that the Stasi imposed at international matches for political reasons. Only a few tickets were sold to ordinary fans for matches in the European Cup against opponents such as Hamburger SV and SV Werder Bremen. The majority was instead sold to a politically hand-picked audience.[190][232] BFC Dynamo also saw the emergence of a well-organized hooligan scene during the 1980s.[174][178] The development was partly a response to the increasing state repression against the supporter scene.[190]\\n\\n\\nThe team celebrates the victory in the 1988-89 FDGB-Pokal at the Stadion der Weltjugend on 1 April 1989.\\nBFC Dynamo met local rival 1.

The team met Karl-Marx-Stadt in the final of the 1988-89 FDGB-Pokal. BFC Dynamo won the match 1–0 in front of 35,000 spectators at the Stadion de Weltjugend and captured its second consecutive cup title. The winning goal was scored by Anderas Thom in the 57th minute.[234] BFC Dynamo eventually finished the 1988-89 DDR-Oberliga as runner-up.

Frank Pastor was transferred to BSG Aktivist Schwarze Pumpe at the beginning of the season. BFC Dynamo was qualified for the 1989–90 European Cup Winners\' Cup as winners of the 1988–89 FDGB-Pokal. The team was eliminated in the second round by AS Monaco on the away goals rule. Coach Helmut Jäschke then decided to place young goalkeeper Oskar Kosche in the following match. Long-time goalkeeper Bodo Rudwaleit ten suddenly announced his immediate retirement from football.[239] The East German regime faltered under pressure from political mass demonstrations and events in neighboring countries. Parts of the Berlin Wall were opened on 9 November 1989 and East German citizens could now freely travel to West Berlin. The Stasi was transformed into the Office for National Security (German: Amt für Nationale Sicherheit) (AfNS) on 17 November 1989.[240] The transformation also ended the tenure of Erich Mielke as Minister of State Security.[241] He would soon be dismissed as the First Chairman of SV Dynamo as well.[242][226] Andreas Thom was signed to Bayer Leverkusen by Bayer Leverkusen manager Reiner Calmund. The transfer became official on 12 December 1989. Thom thus became the first player in the DDR-Oberliga to leave for the West German Bundesliga.[243] The transfer fee amounted to 2,5 million Deutsche Mark.[243]\\n\\n\\nThe team of FC Berlin at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark on 23 February 1990.\\nBodo Rudwaleit was transferred to BSG Stahl Einsenhüttenstadt and Bernd Schulz to BSG Bergmann-Borsig during the 1989–1990 winter break. The dismantling of the team from the 1980s was now well underway.[244] Coach Jäschke was dismissed during the winter break and was replaced by Peter Rohde.[245] Rohde had played 159 league- and 14 international matches for BFC Dynamo between 1969 and 1978 and was an older brother of team captain Frank Rohde.[245] The AfNS was eventually completely dissolved on 13 January 1990.[240] With the dissolution of the Stasi, BFC Dynamo had lost a major sponsor. The Ministry of the Interior announced that it was only prepared to support the club until the end of the 1989–90 season.[246][247][248] The fate of the club was uncertain. BFC Dynamo was rebranded as FC Berlin on 19 February 1990.[249][250] Club President Herbert Krafft was dismissed at the same time and Jürgen Bogs took over as interim president until new club elections could be held.[249] The team participated in the first edition of the indoor tournament \\\"Internationales Berliner Hallenfussballurnier\\\" in the Werner-Seelenbinder-Halle. Teams from West Berlin, such as Hertha BSC also participated. FC Berlin lost the final against arch-rival 1. FC Union Berlin with 4–5. Thomas Doll became the best goal scorer of the tournament with 12 goals.[251] The second half of the season started well, but it soon became clear that FC Berlin would not would not have a chance at the title.[252] FC Berlin finished the 1989-90 DDR-Oberliga in fourth place and failed for the first time in a long time to qualify for a European tournament.[253] Attendance dropped from 7,271 in the fall of 1989 to just 3,383 in the spring of 1990.[254] The team lost Thomas Doll and Frank Rohde to Hamburger SV and Rainer Ernst to 1. FC Kaiserslautern after the season.[255][256]\\n\\n\\nDirk Rehbein chasing the ball during a match between FC Berlin and HFC Chemie at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark on 10 November 1990.\\nThe team was joined by Dirk Rehbein from SC Fortuna Köln during the summer of 1990. FC Berlin participated in the 1990 Intertoto Cup 30 June 1990 and 17 July 1990. FC Berlin had sold off almost all its offensive players during the 1989–90 season and the team finished the tournament in third place.[257][258][259] FC Berlin also recruited Mikhail Pronichev from FC Lokomotiv Moscow for the 1990–91 season.[260][261] The team began the 1990-91 NOFV-Oberliga with four consecutive defeats and was in last place in the league after the fourth matchday. Jürgen Bogs returned as coach.[262][263] A wave of hooliganism swept through East Germany in 1990.[178] One of the largest hooligan scenes in Germany was formed around FC Berlin.[253] 18-year-old FC Berlin supporter Mike Polley was shot dead by police during riots in Leutzsch in connection with the match between FC Sachsen Leipzig and FC Berlin on 3 November 1990. The police had fired between 50 and 100 shots in one minute.[264] The hooligan scene of FC Berlin would shape the entire 1990–91 season.[265] FC Berlin continued to struggle in the second half of the league season. The team was in 12th place in the league towards the end of the season.[266] However, FC Berlin won its last two matches in the league, against Chemnitzer FC and FC Victoria 91 Frankfurt, and finished the 1990-91 NOFV-Oberliga in 11th place.[266] The team was thus qualified for the play-off for the 2. Bundesliga. FC Berlin was one point behind leaders BSV Stahl Brandeburg before the final round. The team defeated 1. FC Magdeburg 3–5 away, but BSV Stahl Brandenburg defeated 1. FC Union Berlin 0–2 away. FC Berlin thus finished in second place and just narrowly failed to qualify for the 2. Bundesliga.[267][268][257] The team lost several key-players after the season, such as Heiko Bonan, Burkhard Reich, Waldemar Ksienzyk, Thorsten Boer, Eike Küttner and Hendrik Herzog.[268][269]\\n\\nDecline (1991-1994)\\nFC Berlin recruited midfielder Ralf Rambow from Eisenhüttenstädter FC Stahl for the 1991–92 season. The 1991–92 season was the first season when teams from East Germany and teams from West Germany played in the same league system. The NOFV-Oberliga was now at third tier in the league system. FC Berlin was qualified for the 1991-92 DFB-Pokal as a participant in the 1990–91 2. Bundesliga play-off. It was the club\'s first participation in the DFB-Pokal. The team was drawn against SC Freiburg. The starting eleven included players such as Oskar Kosche, Christian Backs, Jens-Uwe Zöphel, Jörg Fügner, Mario Tolkmitt and Mikhail Pronichev. FC Berlin lost the match 0–2.[270] Heiko Brestrich returned to the team during the summer of 1991.[271] Brestrich would be a key-player of FC Berlin in the 1990s. FC Berlin came to dominate the 1991-92 NOFV-Oberliga. The team lost only two matches during the entire league season and scored a total of 97 goals.[272] FC Berlin was once again qualified for the play-off for the 2. Bundesliga. The team finished the play-off in third place. Volkswagen-backed VfL Wolfsburg won the play-off, which meant that no team from the former East Germany was able to advance.[272] FC Berlin lost 11 players after the 1991–92 season, including Mario Tolkmitt, Christian Backs, Jörn Lenz, Jörg Fügner and Oskar Kosche.[273][274] In total, FC Berlin lost two complete teams in the first one or two years after the fall of the Berlin Wall.[256]\\n\\nFailing to win win promotion to the 2. Bundesliga, FC Berlin had to continue at amateur level. The main competitors in the following seasons of the NOFV-Oberliga Nord were teams such as Tennis Borussia Berlin, BSV Stahl Brandenburg and Eisenhüttenstädter FC Stahl. With the many player departures after the 1991–92 season, Jürgen Bogs once again had to build a new team.[273] FC Berlin recruited forward Bernd Jopek for 1. FC Union Berlin and midfielder Stefan Oesker from Blau-Weiß 1890 Berlin for the 1992–93 season.[273] The team was also strengthened by a number of youth players.[273] FC Berlin now had to rely on its youth department to supply the team with new players.[275] The team finished the 1992-93 NOFV-Oberliga Nord in fourth place. Dirk Rehbein and Ralf Rambow left for 1. FC Union Berlin after the season.[276][277] FC Berlin was no longer the absolute treasure trove among former East German clubs, but continued to produce talent thanks to its excellent youth work.[277] Among the players from the youth department on the squad in 1993–94 season were Jens Reckmann, Mike Jesse, Ronny Nikol, Michael Franke, Marcell Fensch and Rayk Schröder.[278][275][273][276][277] The team of FC Berlin that played against Spandauer SV on the fifth matchday on 9 September 1993 had an avagerage age of only 21,33 and was the youngest team of BFC Dynamo to have ever played a competitive match.[279] Helmut Koch replaced Jürgen Bogs as coach on 28 September 1993.[280] FC Berlin finished the 1993-94 NOFV-Oberliga Nord in fourth place and qualified for the new Regionalliga Nordost.\\n\\nRegionalliga Nordost and first Berlin cup title (1994–1999)\\nMario Kallnik returned to the club for the 1994–95 season. The re-instated Regionalliga would now form the new third tier in the German football league system. The 1994-95 Regionalliga Nordost meant new meetings with well-known opponents such as FC Carl Zeiss Jena, 1. FC Union Berlin and FC Rot-Weiß Erfurt.[281] BFC Dynamo struggled in the 1994-95 Regionalliga Nordost, but managed to retain its place in the league.[282] Jens-Uwe Zöphel left the team for FC Energie Cottbus after the season. The team was joined by goalkeeper Daniel Bartel from the youth department for the 1995–96 season. Bartel became the new first-choice goalkeeper at the beginning of the season. The highlights of the 1995-96 Regionalliga Nordost were new meetings with old rival 1. FC Dynamo Dresden.[283] The two teams had not met since the 1990–91 season.[284][281] The first meeting was played in front of 2,002 spectators at the Stadion im Sportforum on 8 September 1995. The score was 1–3 at half break.[283] The match ended 4–3 to 1. FC Dynamo Dresden.[284][281] Club President Klaus Bittroff resigned on 14 September 1995 and Vice president Volkmar Wanski became the new club president.[285] The team had a difficult start to the 1995-95 Regionalliga Nordost. Due to acute danger of relegation, coach Koch was dismissed on 17 October 1995. Werner Voigt became the new coach.[286][287] Voigt had a long background in the club as a player and coach. With Voigt, the experienced defender Mario Maek also returned to the club.[286] FC Berlin organized one of the biggest youth football tournaments so far in the eastern part of the country in the Sportforum Hohenschönhausen on 6–8 April 1996. As many as 30 youth teams from clubs such as Chelsea F.C., Everton F.C., Feyenoord, FC Bayern München and Borussia Dortmund participated.[288][287] FC Berlin found itself in the relegation zone towards the end of the 1995-95 Regionalliga Nordost.[289] The place in the league was saved with a 1–0 win over FSV Wacker 90 Nordhausen on the 33rd matchday, 19 May 1996. The winning goal was scored by Mario Maek.[283]\\n\\nExperienced players such as Heiko Brestrich, Mario Maek, and Jens Reckmann would form the team\'s backbone during the 1996–67 season.[290] FC Berlin defeated 1. FC Dynamo Dresden 2–0 in the opening match of the 1996–97 Regionalliga Nordost in front of 2,300 spectators at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark.[291] Then followed a sharp decline.[292] The team would lose 6–0 away to its other rival 1. FC Union on the ninth matchday.[293] It was the biggest loss to date against 1. FC Union Berlin.[294] Club President Wanski announced on 26 November 1996 that the financial reserves had been used up.[287] The millions of Deutsche Mark that the club had made from player transfers in the early 1990s were now gone.[295] Wanski would then support the club every year with personal contributions.[296][297] During the second half of the 1995–96 season, he became shirt sponsor with his own company Regio Bautenschutz GmbH.[290] The shirts had not had a sponsor in almost seven years.[290] FC Berlin also signed a two-year sponsoring contract with the Italian sportswear manufacturer Fila during the spring of 1996, where Fila became the club\'s equipment sponsor. The club previously had no equipment sponsor.[298] Fila had reportedly been impressed by the club\'s youth work.[298] FC Berlin finished the 1996-67 Regionaliga Nordost on 13th place after another weak season. Mikhail Pronichev left the team for TuS Makkabi Berlin and Jens Reckmann for 1. FC Dynamo Dresden after the season.\\n\\nThe team recruited Croatian defender Davor Krznarić for the 1997–98 season. The 1997-98 Regionalliga Nordost was also a struggle, with the team in 12th place in the league at the winter break.[299] The club still received New Year\'s greetings from Real Madrid and Liverpool F.C. in 1997.[300] Experienced defender Jörn Lenz returned to the club during the winter break.[301] Lenz would be a key player for several seasons to come. The successes in the Regionalliga Nordost had not materialized. It became known that coach Voigt had signed for 1. FC Dynamo Dresden for the 1998–99 season. The club and Voigt decided to part ways.[302] Assistant coach Ingo Rentzsch took over on 12 March 1998.[303] The team played an exciting 5–5 draw away against 1. FC Magdeburg away on the 33rd matchday, 5 May 1998. Bernd Jopek, Jörn Lenz, Davor Krznarić, Marek Seruga, and Mario Kallnik scored one goal each in the match.[303][304] New coach for the 1998–99 season was Henry Häusler.[305] Players central to the team in the 1998–99 season were Heiko Brestrich, Jörn Lenz, Mario Maek, Martino Gatti, Mario Kallnik, Davor Krznarić, Timo Lesch, and Sven Ohly, with Lenz as team captain.[305][306] Coach Häusler was eventually dismissed on 18 March 1999 and assistant coach Ingo Rentzsch again took over as interim coach.[307] Club President Wanski came up with the idea to revive the old name BFC Dynamo during the autumn of 1998. He said: \\\"We stand by Dynamo\'s sporting tradition, we reject the club\'s political past.\\\"[308][297] An overwhelming majority at the general meeting on 8 May 1999 voted to take back the old name.[309] The team met local rival Union Berlin on the penultimate matchday of the 1998-99 Regionalliga Nordost, 8 May 1999. The team now again competed as BFC Dynamo. Coach Rentzsch threw in the towel at half-time and left the stadium, allegedly because Club President Wanski had wanted to dictate the line-up.[310][311][312] Youth trainer Norbert Paepke took over as coach in the second half of the match.[310][313] BFC Dynamo won the derby 2–0 with two goals by Marcel Solomo in front of 2,543 spectators at the Stadion an der Alten Försterei.[314] BFC Dynamo reached the final of the 1998-99 Berlin Cup. The team defeated Berlin Türkspor 1965 with 4–1 in the final on 11 May 1999 and finally won its first Berlin Cup title. Ayhan Gezen and Mario Maek scored one goal each, and Heiko Brestrich scored two goals for BFC Dynamo in the final.[315]\\n\\nRelegation to NOFV-Oberliga and crash (1999–2001)\\nBFC Dynamo recruited goalkeeper Nico Thomaschewski for the 1999–2000 season. Thomaschewski became the new first-choice goalkeeper. Torsten Boer, Jens Reckmann and Dirk Rehbein also returned to the club.[316][317] The team was also joined by forward Marcel Riediger from the youth department. Marcel Riediger was the son of former BFC Dynamo striker Hans-Jürgen Riediger.[318][319] The team lost 0–2 to Arminia Bielefeld the first round of the 1999-2000 DFB-Pokal.[320] BFC Dynamo defeated SG Dynamo Dresden 1–0 on the sixth matchday.[316] The team stood at a sensational second place in the league after the eight matchday, but then followed a sharp descline.[321][322] BFC Dynamo suffered a period of crisis during the autumn of 1999.[323] The financial difficulties had continued. The number of sponsors was too few and the club was financially dependent on Club President Volkmar Wanski. The number of spectators also remained low and new sponsors were deterred by hooliganism.[311] The team went through several league matches without a single win. Heiko Brestrich eventually rebelled against coach Klaus Goldbach in early November 1999 and was suspended. He was then sacked and transferred to VfB Leipzig.[324][325][326][327] Brestrich was very popular with the supporters of BFC Dynamo and was popularly called \\\"Heiko Brestrich - Football God\\\" (German: Heiko Brestrich - Fußballgott).[324][328] He had played a total of 301 matches for BFC Dynamo during his career, including 282 matches between 1991 and 1999.[324][329] The team was joined by Russian striker Denis Kozlov later the same month. Kozlov would eventually prove successful at BFC Dynamo. Coach Goldbach was eventually dismissed in early December 1999 and Jürgen Bogs returned for his third stint as coach.[330]\\n\\nThe club finally got a promising main sponsor in the form of the software company Lipro AG at the beginning of 2000.[331][332] However, the difficulties in the league continued and the club\'s liabilities had already started to become significant.[332] BFC Dynamo finished the 1999-2000 Regionalliga Nordost in 17th place and was relegated to the NOFV-Oberliga Nord. For the first time in its history, BFC Dynamo was now a fourth tier team.[333] BFC Dynamo reached the final of the Berlin Cup for a second consecutive season, but lost the final of the 1999-2000 Berlin Cup 2–0 against the reserve team of Tennis Borussia Berlin.[334] Club President Wanski resigned on 29 June 2000.[335][336][337] The reason was allegedly that the sponsor Lipro AG demanded greater influence in club decision making.[335][336] The club was now temporary in the hands of Sports director Hans Reker.[335] Mario Maek retired as a player after the 1999–2000 season and several players left the team, including Thorsten Boer and Martino Gatti.[335][336] A new team was put together for the 2000-01 NOFV-Oberliga Nord. The budget for the season was 2.3 million Deutsche Mark, which set new record for the NOFV-Oberliga Nord.[336] The team was joined by striker Dirk Vollmar, Cameroonian midfielder Aka Adek Mba, Brazilian midfielder Alexandre Vieira dos Santos, nicknamed \\\"Macalé\\\", as well as five Romanian players: Dănuț Oprea, Silvian Cristescu, Aurel Panait, Dorel Zegrean, and Florin Bătrânu.[336][338] SPD-politician Karin Halsch became new club president on 27 September 2000.[339][340][nb 7] BFC Dynamo dominated the 2000-01 NOFV-Oberliga Nord. The team was drawn against arch-rival 1. FC Union Berlin in the quarter-finals of the 2000-01 Berlin Cup The match was played in front of 4,427 spectators at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark on 24 March 2001. BFC Dynamo lost 3–0.[341] Serious riots broke out after the match when BFC Dynamo supporters clashed with the police.[342] The team finished the 2000-01 NOFV-Oberliga in first place, with only three losses in 34 matches.[343] Denis Kozlov had scored a wopping 29 goals for BFC Dynamo in the league.[343] The team would now face 1. FC Magdeburg in a play-off for promotion to the Regionalliga Nord.\\n\\nHowever, it had become apparent that the club had serious financial problems two weeks before the play-offs. Players and coaches had received their January salaries in March and had not received any salaries since. The club was also behind with insurance payments.[344][345][346] The German Football Association (DFB) demanded that the club could provide a bank guarantee of 4.2 million Deutsche Mark to secure the budget for the possible 2001–02 Regionalliga Nord. It was already clear before the first match in the play-offs that the club would have difficulty meeting the requirements of the DFB in the event of promotion.[343][347] The first match of the play-offs ended 0–0 in front of 8,282 spectators at the Stadion im Sportforum on 2 June 2001.[348] The second match was played at the Ernst-Grube-Stadion in Magdeburg on 9 June 2001. Around 2,000 supporters from BFC Dynamo traveled to the second match.[349][350] The score was 2–2 at half time. BFC Dynamo was practically promoted at this point.[348] However, the team ultimately lost the match 2–5.[348][351] The club\'s debts were now estimated at 1.5 million Deutsche Mark.[352] And now, also the main sponsor Lipro AG was in financial trouble.[353][354] Several players left the club directly after the 2000–01 season, including Marcel Riediger and Denis Kozlov.[343][352]\\n\\nInsolvency (2001–2002)\\nInsurance company AOK filed for insolvency against BFC Dynamo on 21 June 2001. The company demanded 126,000 Deutsche Mark in unpaid insurance payments.[355] Club President Karin Halsch resigned on 25 June 2001.[355] There had been major discrepancies between Halsch and sports director Hans Reker regarding how the situation should be resolved.[355] Reker took over as acting president.[356] Supporters of BFC Dynamo started the fundraiser \\\"Save BFC Dynamo\\\" (German: Rettet den BFC). The fundraiser quickly succeeded in raising 40,000 Euros.[357][358][359] More players left the team during the summer of 2001, including Mario Kallnik and Aka Adeck Mba.[360] The debts were estimated at 5 millions Deutsche Mark, of which 4.2 million were loans from Lipro AG and 1.3 short-term debts, at this point.[361] The club tried to initiate a partnership with FC Dynamo Moscow, in which BFC Dynamo would serve as a farm team for FC Dynamo Moscow in Europe.[362] But the plan led nowhere.[363] A preliminary insolvency administrator was appointed at the end of August 2001.[364] It was estimated that insolvency proceedings could be opened on 1 November 2001.[365] Insolvency proceedings were opened against main sponsor Lipro AG on 5 October 2001.[366]\\n\\nThe preliminary insolvency administrator estimated the club\'s debts at 6 million Deutsche Mark.[367] BFC Dynamo needed 30,000 Deutsche Mark by 31 October 2001 in order to commence insolvency proceedings.[368] However, the club did not have the money.[369] Discussions with new sponsors failed.[370] If insolvency proceedings could not be opened, the club would go bankrupt and have to restart in the Kreisliga under a new name.[363][365][371][368] Supporters organized a demonstration that marched from the Sportforum Hohenschönhausen to the Rotes Rathaus. Also former players such as Hans-Jürgen Riediger, Rainer Troppa, Waldemar Ksienzyk and Heiko Brestrich planned to participate. The demonstration was received at the Rotes Rathaus by former club president and SPD-politician Halsch.[369][372][368] A group of sponsors around former president Volkmar Waski finally came forward and offered the money required to commence insolvency proceedings.[373][374] The club\'s entire presidium resigned on 31 October 2001.[375][337] An emergency board formed by André Sommer, Rayk Bernt and press spokesman Holger Zimmermann was appointed by the club\'s Economic Council.[376][370]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo is said to have made millions on player sales after Die Wende.[356][377][378] The club was for a time considered the richest amateur club in Germany.[295] But not all the money had went to the club, some had also went to SV Dynamo, DFV and advisers.[379][380] The club\'s reputation as the former Stasi club made it difficult to win new sponsors.[296][381][356][382] The club was also plagued by hooliganism, which repeatedly caused negative headlines.[382][340] FC Berlin failed to qualify for the 2. Bundesliga and never progressed beyond the third tier of the German football league system.[383] The number of spectators was only a couple of hundred per match in the early 1990s and the income from membership fees was marginal.[382][383] The club also maintained a large youth department which at one point cost about 400,000 Deutsche Mark per year.[382] At the end of 1996, the club still had no debts, but also no money left in its bank accounts.[296] President Wanski would then have to support the club with his own financial contributions.[296] It is estimated that Wanski invested an estimated 3 million Deutsche Mark of private money in the club over the five years before his resignation.[384] BFC Dynamo finally got a promising new sponsor in the form of Lipro AG in early 2000. Millions of Deutsche Mark would now be available.[385] But the club\'s liabilites had already started to become significant.[385] The club made a bid to reach the third tier Regionalliga Nord, and sports director Hans Reker started signing new players.[385] However, the millions from sponsor Lipro AG would later turn out to be loans.[385]\\n\\nThe emergency board was considered to represent the interest of the sponsor group around Wanski.[386] André Sommer and Rayk Bernt were controversial due to their membership in the Hells Angels.[387] However, both were also long-time supporters; Sommer had been a member of the hooligan scene back in the 1980s.[388][389] Zimmermann resigned from the emergency board on 23 November 2001, as he thought Sommer and Berndt had given the club an image he could not identify with.[390] A new presidium was due to be elected at a general meeting on 26 November 2001.[337] But the general meeting was converted into an \\\"information event\\\" by a vote of 87 to 59, at the insistence of the emergency board.[390][391] Some club members felt they had been blackmailed.[391] Sommer and Bernt continued to lead the club during the opening of the insolvency proceedings, but the legitimacy of their presidium was questioned.[390]\\n\\nInsolvency proceedings were opened on 1 November 2001.[392][393][394] BFC Dynamo was thus automatically relegated to the Verbandsliga Berlin.[372] All contracts with professionals and employees were terminated.[372][395][396][393] The club now had to continue under amateur conditions, the players could only be offered 300 Euros per month.[369][337] Only three players from the original squad remained for the first mandatory friendly match, one of them was team captain Piotr Rowicki.[397][337] Jörn Lenz left for VfB Leipzig and Nico Thomaschewski for SV Babelsberg 03.[337] Coach Jürgen Bogs also decided not to continue.[374][398] Former assistant coach Mario Maek stepped in as the new coach on a voluntary basis, assisted by goalkeeping coach Bodo Rudwaleit.[398] The club once again had to rely on its youth players.[399]\\n\\nSommer and Bernt met great opposition due to their membership in the Hells Angels.[400] The duo had a deterrent effect and failed to attract new sponsors.[388][401] Supporters collected signatures to elect a new presidium.[388][402] But the signatures were ignored by Sommer and Berndt.[388][402] The former coach of the women\'s team Volkmar Lucius then took legal action for violation of the statutes.[388][402] The Sommer and Bernt presidium was then finally overthrown by supporters and Lucius, through a successful application to the Charlottenburg District Court.[388][402][401] The court appointed Lucius as an emergency board member on 30 April 2002.[388][403] Sommer and Bernt had, after all, helped make sure that the insolvency proceedings could be opened by their personal financial contributions.[402][404] But the duo would no longer have much say in the club after 2003.[405] The interest group IG BFC\'er managed to persuade entrepreneur Mike Peters to become the new club president.[401][404] Peters was elected as the new president on 31 May 2002.[406] The preferential claims of 204,000 Euros looked insurmountable.[401] But the supporters had negotiated with creditors and received numerous waivers.[401][407] They had also set up a donations account and collected at least 13,800 Euros themselves.[407][406] The new presidum around Peters would also contribute 100,000 Euros from private money to the insolvency plan.[406][401][407] Peters also committed to funding a large part of the budget for the 2002-03 Verbandsliga Berlin.[406][408]\\n\\nRestart in Verbandsliga Berlin and end of insolvency (2002–2004)\\nFormer BFC Dynamo player Dirk Vollmar became the new coach for the 2002–03 season.[406] Bodo Rudwaleit continued as assistant coach.[406] Nico Thomaschewski and Aka Adeck Mba returned for the 2002–03 season.[409][410] The team was also joined by defender Robert Rudwaleit from the reserve team.[411][408][412] Robert Rudwaleit was the son of Bodo Rudwaleit and had made his first few appearances with the first team during the previous season.[413] BFC Dynamo defeated the reserve team of 1. FC Union Berlin in both meetings in 2002-03 Verbandsliga Berlin.[414] The team eventuallty finished its first season in the Verbandsliga Berlin in third place.[414] The insolvency situation was complex. The club had about 170 creditors. It was still unclear whether the insolvency proceedings could be successful.[415]\\n\\nJörn Lenz returned to the club for the 2003–04 season.[416] BFC Dynamo also recruited striker Danny Kukulies from SC Pfullendorf for the season. Kukulies had a long background in the youth department of BFC Dynamo.[417] BFC Dynamo was in third place after the first half of the season, nine points behind BFC Preussen and six points behind second placed SV Tasmania Gropiusstadt 73.[418] The team defeated SV Tasmania Gropiusstadt 73 2–1 in the first league match after the winter break, with one goal by Lenz and one goal by Robert Rudwaleit.[419] The team would also win the following matches.[420] BFC Dynamo eventually finished the 2003-04 Verbandsliga Berlin in first place and won promotion back to the NOFV-Oberliga Nord. The team had won all 17 matches in the second half of the league season, which set new record in the Verbandsliga Berlin.[421] Danny Kukulies scored 32 goals and Tomasz Suwary 22 goals in the 2003-04 Verbandsliga Berlin.[422] The insolvency proceedings would finally come to a positive conclusion after a meeting with the creditors at the Charlottenburg District Court on 8 June 8, 2004.

The team is occasionally nicknamed \\\"die Weinroten\\\", which means \\\"the Clarets\\\".[626][627]\\n\\nThe BFC Dynamo away kit has traditionally been a white shirt, paired with claret or white shorts and socks. However, the team used green away shirts from the end of the 1960s until the mid-1970s.[628][83] Green was the colour of the Volkspolizei, which was the official sponsor of BFC Dynamo during the East German era. The green away shirt was then exchanged for a white away shirt, paired with red or white shorts and socks.[93][99] The team used entirely red away kits during the 1981–82 and 1982–83 seasons.[629][630] The red away kit was then exchanged for a claret away kit.[631] The team again used white away shirts from the 1985–86 season.[632] The 1985–86 season also saw the instruction of a new claret and white diagonally striped away shirt.[632] The diagonally striped away shirt would be used for the rest of the 1980s.[237]\\n\\nThe club was rebranded as FC Berlin on 19 February 1990. A pure white was set as the new match colour with immediate effect.[633] FC Berlin then adopted a red and white colour scheme for the 1990–91 season.[634] In the eyes of the supporters, the red and white kit looked a lot like 1. FC Union Berlin.[634] The club played in red and white home kits for most of the FC Berlin era, but wore a black and red striped home shirt, paired with black shorts and socks from the 1996–97 season through the 1998–99 season. The club returned to its original club name on 3 May 1999 and consequently also later returned to its traditional colour scheme.[635]\\n\\n1966-1990, 1999–2009, 2023-\\n1966-1990, 1999–2009, 2023-\\n\\n \\n2009-2023\\n2009-2023\\n\\nThe crest of BFC Dynamo during the East German era featured a stylized \\\"D\\\" for SV Dynamo and the lettering \\\"BFC\\\" in red and yellow on a white background, surrounded by a yellow wreath.[636][637] BFC Dynamo abandoned its East German crest when the club was rebranded as FC Berlin on 19 February 1990.[638][639][636] The club used two different crests during the FC Berlin era. The first crest featured a stylized image of the roof of the Brandenburg Gate with the lettering \\\"FCB\\\" underneath and the club name \\\"Fussballclub Berlin\\\" in capital letters at the bottom, in white on a red background. It was only briefly used during the spring of 1990.[640] The second crest featured a stylized image of a football with the Brandenburg Gate in front, the lettering \\\"FCB\\\" at the top and the club name \\\"FC Berlin\\\" at the bottom, in red on a white background. This crest was used from the spring of 1990 until the end of the FC Berlin era.[640][284]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo reclaimed its East German crest when the club returned to its original club name on 3 May 1999.[639] But the club was no longer in possession of the crest.[639] The club had neglected to seek legal protection for its East German crest after German reunification. The neglect was likely due to managerial inexperience. Protection of trademarks was neither necessary nor common in East Germany.[636] The crest was now owned by Peter Klaus-Dieter Mager, commonly known as \\\"Pepe\\\". Pepe Mager was a famous fan of Hertha BSC and a fan merchandise dealer.[641] The club tried to recover the crest from Mager though court action, without success.[639][636] The ownership of the crest was instead passed on to Rayk Bernt and his company RA-BE Immobilien- und Handelsgesellschaft mbH.[479][642][643]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo continued to use the disputed crest on its kits and webpage. But the club would have to ask the owner of the crest every time it wanted to have a pennant made and was unable to exploit the commercial value of the crest for its own benefit.[479][516] The legal situation around the crest would also have caused problems in the event of an advance to the Regionalliga, as the German football Association (DFB) required clubs to own their crests.[517] In order establish independence, the club finally decided to adopt a new crest in 2009.[467]\\n\\nThe new crest abandoned the traditional stylized \\\"D\\\" and the lettering \\\"BFC\\\", as they would have met legal obstacles.[643] The new crest featured a black Berlin bear on claret and white stripes, together with the club name and the founding year.[643] The first version of the new crest sparked controversy. The word \\\"fußball\\\" in the club name had been written in lower case with a double \\\"s\\\" instead of the graphene \\\"ß\\\".[643] This was contrary to German spelling rules, where it is only permissible to write \\\"fußball\\\" with a double \\\"s\\\" when the word is written in upper case. Club President Norbert Uhlig ensured that there was absolutely no ulterior motive behind the spelling and claimed that the word had always been spelled like that on club pennants and scarfs.[643] The Chairman of the Economic Council Peter Meyer later claimed that the spelling was a deliberate marketing ploy, in order to have new crest immediately known across Germany.[643] A second version of the crest was soon made public, where the club name was written in upper case. The new crest was used by BFC Dynamo from the 2009–10 season.[516]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo finally managed win back the traditional crest in 2022, through the Chairman of the Economic Council Peter Meyer. Meyer had acquired the rights to the crest through one of his companies.[644] From the 2023–24 season, BFC Dynamo is once again playing with its traditional crest. The traditional crest was displayed for the first time since its reintroduction in a friendly match against Hertha BSC in front of more than 10,000 spectators at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark on 7 July 2023.[645][646]\\n\\nOwnership of the traditional crest\\nMany clubs in East Germany rushed to drop their East German names during the Peaceful revolution. BFC Dynamo was among the clubs to do so, in an attempt to distance the club from the Stasi.[639][250] The club was rebranded as FC Berlin on 19 February 1990 and consequently abandoned its East German crest.\\n\\nPepe Mager was a famous fan of Hertha BSC and fan merchandise dealer.[641] Mager had organized away trips for the fans Hertha in the early 1960s and was one of the founders of the notorious supporter group \\\"Hertha-Frösche\\\". He now sold his own fan merchandise from a mobile stand outside the Olympiastadion.[641][647][648] Mager inquired with the register of associations in Charlottenburg in 1991 about all deleted names of East German clubs.[641] He immediately found BFC Dynamo and saw business opportunities.[641][639] Mager claimed that he first secured the former crest of BFC Dynamo for 80 D-Marks in 1992.[381][643]\\n\\nThe name FC Berlin never became popular with the fans.[250] Fans continued to identify themselves with the former name and crest.[639] An overwhelming majority voted for the club to take back its original club name at the general meeting on 3 May 1999.[635] Of the 135 present, 125 voted in favor, three against and seven abstained.[309] BFC Dynamo thus reclaimed its East German crest, but the rights to the crest now belonged to Mager.[639] Mager had registered the crest in his name at the German Patent and Trademark Office on 13 May 1997.[639][649][636]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo contacted Mager for a co-operation, but an agreement could not be reached.[641][649] Mager held the opinion that the club should buy its merchandise from him, or simply buy the rights to the crest.[639] He later informed the club that he had received interest from foreign buyers and offered the club to buy the rights.[649] He claimed that the crest was worth 200,000 D-Marks.[639] BFC Dynamo on the other hand claimed that the crest should legally belong to the club. The club sued Mager in court on 20 November 2000, but eventually lost the case.[639][636] The club decided to suspend the legal dispute with Mager in the summer of 2001 and instead wanted to find a solution outside court.[650] Mager was repeatedly exposed to minor threats from the environment around BFC Dynamo and eventually sold the crest to Rayk Bernt and his company RA-BE Immobilien- und Handelsgesellschaft mbH for a price of 50,000 D-Marks in June 2002.[479][642][517][651]\\n\\nBernt was a close associate of André Sommer.[652] Bernt and Sommer had assisted the club at the opening of the insolvency proceedings in 2001–2002.[652][453][479] Both were long time fans of BFC Dynamo.[653][479][642] But the duo was controversial for their connections to Hells Angels.[653][652] Bernt and Sommer were almost as restrictive towards the club when it came to the crest as Mager had been. Bernt organized the production of fan merchandise in his own regime.[642] The club would have to ask his company every time it wanted to have a pennant made.[479] Bernt and Sommer usually agreed, manufactured the pennant and then sold it at their own fan merchandise stand at the stadium.[479] BFC Dynamo continued to use the crest and would at times be given ten percent of the revenues from their sales.[453][479][642][643] The club eventually offered 5,000 Euros for the crest, but was turned down.[453] Sponsor Peter Meyer was also said to have offered 150,000 euros for the buyback.[478] Bernt demanded a seven-digit sum, according to former Club President Mario Weinkauf.[453] The lawyer representing RA-BE Immobilien- und Handelsgesellschaft mbH allegedly claimed the crest was worth around 600,000 Euros at the time.[654]\\n\\nPresident Weinkauf planned to recover the rights to the former crest with the help of Thomas Thiel and the company Treasure AG before the general meeting on 23 June 2007. Thiel was a co-owner of Treasure AG, which was intended as a new major sponsor.[479] Bernt sold parts of the rights to the former crest to Thiel.[655] The price was allegedly a six-digit sum.[479][643] According to the plan, the club would be given the rights of use to the crest. The profits would thus go to the club. The club would pay a symbolic sum of 1 Euro per month for the rights of use. BFC Dynamo would then have a right of first refusal after the ten-year contract had expired and thus have the opportunity to eventually acquire ownership of the crest.[479][656] However, Weinkauf was ultimately rejected by club members in a vote of no-confidence at the general meeting on 23 June 2007.[485] Weinkauf would then be contacted by the former president of Tennis Borussia Berlin Peter Antony. Treasure AG became a sponsor of Tennis Borussia Berlin instead and Weinkauf would later become president of the club.[480]\\n\\nThiel sold his rights to the crest back to Bernt and his company BFC Dynamo Vermarktungsgesellschaft m.b.H in 2009.[657] The rights to the old crest where subsequently controlled again by the company RA-BE Immobilien- und Handelsgesellschaft mbH.[658][659] The company is controlled by Bernt, who sold occasional items with the former crest at his own webpage.[638] However, RA-BE Immobilien- und Handelsgesellschaft mbH transferred its rights to company AXXON AG in 2022.[660][661] In connection with the club\'s 57th anniversary in 2023, the Chairman of the Economic Council Peter Meyer revealed in an exclusive interview with Berliner Kurier that he had acquired the rights to the crest for the club through one of his companies. After more than 13 years, the traditional crest was finally back with the club. According to Berliner Kurier and Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk (MDR), a six-digit sum is said to have become due.[644][662]\\n\\nChampionship star\\nThe German Football League (DFL) introduced a system of championship stars in the 2004–05 season. The system was meant to honor the most successful teams in the Bundesliga by allowing teams to display stars on their shirts for the championships they have won. The system awarded one star for three titles, two stars for five titles, and three stars for ten titles.[663] However, the system only counted titles won in the Bundesliga since the 1963–64 season.[664][665][666]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo submitted an application to the DFL and the DFB on 9 August 2004 to receive three stars for its ten titles in the DDR-Oberliga. The club asked for equal rights and argued that the German Football Association (DFB) had absorbed the German Football Association of the GDR (DFV) with all its statistics, international matches and goal scorers.[663][667][668][664] BFC Dynamo received support from Dynamo Dresden and 1. FC Magdeburg in its attempts to achieve recognition for East German titles.[667][664]\\n\\nThe DFL responded that it was not the responsible body, but the DFB remained silent for a long time.[665] The DFB eventually declared itself responsible and recommended BFC Dynamo to submit a formal application for a new title symbol in accordance with a relevant paragraph.[664][665] BFC Dynamo commissioned a law firm in Mitte in January 2005 and sent a new letter to the DFB. The DFB announced that the application from BFC Dynamo was going to be negotiated in a meeting with the DFB presidium.[665] The meeting with the DFB presidium on 18 March 2005 agreed that all titles won in East Germany, as well all others titles won in Germany since the first recognized championship in 1903, should qualify for stars.[669] However, the decision was subject to approval by the DFL.[670] No final decision had yet been made by the DFB presidium.[671][672][673][674]\\n\\n\\nBFC Dynamo is allowed to wear one star inscribed with the number ten for its ten East German championships.\\nHowever, BFC Dynamo took matters in its own hands and unilaterally emblazoned its shirts with three stars.[672] The team displayed the three stars for first time in the match against FC Energie Cottbus II on 25 March 2005.[672] The claim by BFC Dynamo was controversial because the club had been the favorite club of Erich Mielke and had had a connection to the Stasi during the East German era.[672][673][675][676][666] Critics in the DFB environment pointed to politically influenced championships in East Germany. BFC Dynamo had been sponsored by the Stasi and had enjoyed advantages.[665] The club had privileged access to talents and a permanent training camp at Uckley in Königs Wusterhausen. However, also other clubs in East Germany had enjoyed similar advantages, which put the DFB in a difficult situation.[665] Also former East German referee and CDU parliamentarian Bernd Heynemann spoke out for recognition of all East German titles.[666]\\n\\nThe DFL rejected the application from the DFB and recommended the DFB to only honor clubs that were champions in the Bundesliga.[677] However, the DFB chose to not follow the recommendation. The DFB presidium instead decided on a compromise solution on 19 July 2005 and adopted a new regulation for the 2005–06 season which gave all clubs the right to wear one single star for the championships they have won in the former East Germany and in Germany since 1903. Clubs were also allowed to indicate the number of championships they have won in the center of the star.[678][679][680] The regulation only applies to clubs playing in a league under the DFB umbrella. It does not apply to clubs playing in the 2. Bundesliga and Bundesliga, which are organized by the DFL.[679]\\n\\nThe new regulation meant that BFC Dynamo was finally allowed to emblazon its shirts with a championship star. The regulation also affected other former East German teams including Dynamo Dresden with its eight titles, 1. FC Frankfurt with its six titles and Magdeburg with its three titles in the Oberliga.[665][680] BFC Dynamo has since then used the championship star in accordance with DFB graphic standards, displaying a star inscribed with the number ten for its ten East German titles.[681]\\n\\nStadiums\\nMain article: Stadion im Sportforum\\nThe long-time home and training facility of BFC Dynamo is the Sportforum Hohenschönhausen in Alt-Hohenschönhausen in Berlin. The sports complex is the location of the club offices and the clubhouse.[637] It is also the base of the youth teams.[637] More than 20 youth teams of BFC Dynamo regularly train at the facilities.[682] The Sportforum Hohenschönhausen is considered the spiritual home of the club.[637]\\n\\nThe Sportforum Hohenschönhausen was known as the Dynamo-Sportforum during the East German era.[683] The sports complex was built as a training center for elite sport and was home to sports club SC Dynamo Berlin, with its many departments and squads.[684][685] Development began in 1954 and expansion continued into the 1980s.[686] The Sportforum is still unique as of today.[687] The sports complex covers an area of 45 to 50 hectares and comprises 35 sports facilities as of 2020.[684][687][688][689]\\n\\n\\nA match between SC Dynamo Berlin and SC Turbine Erfurt at the Walter-Ulbricht-Stadion in 1959.\\nSC Dynamo Berlin played its first season at the large Walter-Ulbricht-Stadion in Mitte.[17][690] The team moved its home matches to the football stadium in the Dynamo-Sportforum for the short transitional 1955 season.[691] SC Dynamo Berlin returned to the Walter-Ulbricht-Stadion for the 1956 season.[690] The team would play at the Walter-Ublricht-Stadion for the rest of the 1950s.[690]\\n\\nSC Dynamo Berlin eventually moved its home matches permanentely to the Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum after the construction of the Berlin wall began on 13 August 1961.[17][692] The football stadium in the Dynamo-Sportforum held a capacity of 10,000 spectators at the beginning of the 1961–62 season.[683][nb 8] The team drew average attendances between 3,000 and 6,000 spectators in the DDR-Oberliga at the Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum in the 1960s.[704][705] The highlights were matches against local rival ASK Vorwärts Berlin and the various top teams during the period. The capacity of the football stadium in the Dynamo-Sportforum was gradually expanded during the 1960s.[692][nb 9]\\n\\n\\nA match between BFC Dynamo and BSG Chemie Leipzig at the Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum in 1966.\\nBFC Dynamo began playing occasional matches that required floodlights at the larger Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark in Prenzlauer Berg from November 1968.[692] The Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark was the home ground of FC Vorwärts Berlin at the time. However, the stadium became vacant when FC Vorwärts Berlin was relocated to Frankfurt an der Oder on 31 July 1971.[63] BFC Dynamo played its home matches in the 1971-72 European Cup Winners\' Cup at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark.[708] The matches against Åtvidabergs FF in the quarter-finals on 22 March 1972 and FC Dynamo Moscow in the semi-finals on 5 April 1972 were each attended by 30,000 spectators.[709][710] The team also played two home matches in the 1971-72 DDR-Oberliga at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark.[711] However, more matches at the stadium were not possible after the summer of 1972, as the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark was then undergoing extensive renovation for the upcoming 10th World Festival of Youth and Students.[690]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo was qualified for the 1972-73 UEFA Cup. However, neither the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark nor the Walter-Ulbricht-Stadion were available for the upcoming UEFA Cup matches. Both were undergoing extensive renovation for the 10th World Festival of Youth and Students. Instead, the Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum underwent a complete transformation in just five weeks between the end of July 1972 and September 1972.[690] The capacity of the Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum was now expanded to 20,000 spectators.[712][713][692] BFC Dynamo played all home matches in the 1972-73 UEFA Cup at the Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum. The attendance of 20,000 spectators during the match against Liverpool on 29 November 1972 is still a record attendance for the stadium.[696] BFC Dynamo remained at the Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum for a couple more seasons. The team saw rising attendance numbers at the Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum during the 1970s.[714] An average of 12,000 people attended the last six matches of BFC Dynamo at the Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum in the second half of the 1973–74 season.[692] The match between BFC Dynamo and 1. FC Magdeburg in the 1974-75 DDR-Oberliga at the Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum on 8 March 1975 was attended by a whole 19,000 spectators.[715]\\n\\n\\nA match between BFC Dynamo and SG Dynamo Dresden in front of 25,000 spectators at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark in 1976.[716]\\nBFC Dynamo eventually moved its home matches to the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark for the 1975–76 season, due to upcoming repair work at the Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum.[692] The move was meant to be temporary, but eventually became permanent.[692] The Dynamo-Sportforum would primarily serve as a training facility from then and the football stadium would be used mostly by the reserve team BFC Dynamo II. The Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark held a capacity of 30,00 spectators in the 1975–76 season.[708] The average home attendance of 16,538 spectators for BFC Dynamo at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Stadion in the 1975-76 DDR-Oberliga is the highest average league attendance in club history.[17][717] BFC Dynamo celebrated nine of its ten DDR-Oberliga titles in the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Stadium. The team also played most of its home matches in the UEFA competitions at the stadium. BFC Dynamo hosted teams such as Shakhtar Donetsk, Red Star Belgrade, Nottingham Forest, Hamburger SV, Aston Villa, AS Roma FC Aberdeen at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Stadium in the 1970s and 1980. However, all matches in the derby against 1. FC Union Berlin were played at the neutral Stadion der Weltjugend from the 1976–77 season for security reasons.[294][718][719][720]\\n\\nA permanent training camp for BFC Dynamo was built in Uckley in the Zernsdorf district of Königs Wusterhausen in Bezirk Potsdam at the end of the 1960s.[721] It was located in the woods and completely sealed off from the surroundings.[721][722] The training camp covered an area of around 10 hectares.[722] The complex was equipped with a boarding school, several football pitches, a sports hall, a swimming pool, a fitness area and a sauna.[723][724][725][722][726] The team would gather in Uckley days before its European matches.[17] The players would have access to catering facilities, a nearby lake, a bowling alley, a cinema and pinball machines, among other things.[725][726]\\n\\n\\nThe team of BFC Dynamo in front of the new grandstand of the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark in 1987.\\nBFC Dynamo moved its home matches temporary to the Dynamo-Sportforum for the 1986–87 season, as the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark was undrgoing redevelopment during the season for the upcoming 750th anniversary of Berlin.[692][708] The team also played its home matches in the 1986-87 European Cup at the Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum. The team then returned to the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark for the 1987–88 season.[727] The Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark now had a new four storey grandstand and new floodlight masts. The current grandstand and the floodlights of the stadium dates from this time.[696] The club was rebranded as FC Berlin after Die Wende. FC Berlin moved permanently to the Stadion im Sportforum at the beginning of the 1992–93 season.[696] The team would remain in the Sportforum Hohenschönhausen for many seasons to come.[692]\\n\\nThe capacity of the Stadion im Sportforum had been reduced to about 12,000 spectators by 1992.[692] FC Berlin only drew an average of a couple of hundred spectators per match at the Stadion im Sportforum in the mid-1990s. The highlights were the matches against 1. FC Union Berlin. FC Berlin under Club President Volkmar Wanski announced plans in April 1998 to buy and modernize the stadium.[300] However, the plans eventually failed due to lack of funds. The team saw rising attendance numbers at the Stadion im Sportforum at the end of the 1990s.[714] Active supporters of BFC Dynamo were traditionally found at the northern curved end, popularly known as the Nordwall stand.[717] 4,220 spectators watched the match between BFC Dynamo and Union Berlin at the Stadion im Sportforum on 23 November 1999.[728]\\n\\nSupporters of BFC Dynamo installed new bucket seats on the main stand and built a new clubhouse next to the main stand of the Stadion im Sportforum in 2002–2003.[729] The Stadion im Sportforum was then equipped with a 25-metre player tunnel and plexiglass-clad coaching benches in November 2004.[730] BFC Dynamo made new plans for a modern football stadium in the Sportforum Hohenschönhausen in 2006 under Club President Mario Weinkauf. The club now wanted to build a new modern stadium for 10,000–15,000 spectators.[731] However, these plans did not materialize either. The Stadion im Sportforum was closed at the end of the 2005–06 season following the riots during the match between BFC Dynamo and Union Berlin on 13 May 2006.[457] BFC Dynamo temporarily had to move to the Friedrich-Ludwg-Jahn-Sportpark.[461] The stadium was then refurbished in 2006–2007 to increase safety and meet the requirements of the NOFV.[487] The refurbishment included a new fence.[732]\\n\\n\\nA match between BFC Dynamo and SV Babelsberg 03 on 23 April 2017.\\nBFC Dynamo won promotion to the Regionalliga Nordost at the end of the 2013–14 season. The team moved permanently to the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark for the 2014–15 season, due to increased media and spectator interest following its promotion.[696][733] The 2014-15 Regionalliga Nordost meant matches against well-known opponents such as 1. FC Magdeburg and FC Carl Zeiss Jena. The more central location of the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark was seen by the club as an opportunity to attract more spectators.[733] The match between BFC Dynamo and 1. FC Magdeburg on 8 November 2014 was attended by 5,103 spectators.[734] Active supporters of BFC Dynamo have traditionally been found on the main stand, and on the side opposite the main stand (German: die Gegengerade) of the Friedrich Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark.[717] The match between BFC Dynamo and FC Schalke 04 in the first round of the 2018-19 DFB-Pokal at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark on 17 August 2017 was watched by 14,117 spectators.[570] The attendance was the highest attendance for BFC Dynamo since the fall of the Berlin wall.[570][86] The average league attendance of BFC Dynamo in the 2017-18 Regionalliga Nordost would also be the highest average league attendance of BFC Dynamo since the 1990-91 season.[705]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo had to play a number of matches at the Stadion im Sportforum at the end of the 2018–19 season due to safety issues relating to the dilapidated floodlights at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark.[735] The move was greeted by some supporters as a move to the true home of the club.[736] The club was then set to return to the Sportforum in the 2020–21 season as the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark was planned to be demolished for a complete redevelopment.[637] The team was allowed to continue play in the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark until 31 December 2020.[737] BFC Dynamo then officially announced on 21 March 2021 that the club was going to move back to the Sportforum Hohenschönhausen for the next season.[738]\\n\\nThe Stadion im Sportforum was equipped with a floodlight system in April 2021.[739][740] The club organized a work effort in the summer of 2021 to get the stadium in shape for the upcoming Regionalliga season. [741] Supporters of BFC Dynamo gathered and cleared sections of the old stadium from weeds.[742] Members of the interest group IG BFC\'er also restored the iconic manual scoreboard above the curved end towards the Weißenseer Weg in time for the first home match of the 2021–22 season against Energie Cottbus on 28 July 2021.[743] The attendance for BFC Dynamo at the Stadion im Sportforum in the 2021-22 Regionalliga Nordost was almost tripled compared to the last comparable league season before the COVID-19 pandemic. 3,219 people watched the match between BFC Dynamo and FC Carl Zeiss Jena on 10 April 2022.[744]\\n\\nFuture stadium\\nThe large stadium in the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark is planned to be demolished towards the end of 2023 for a complete redevelopment.[745] The new stadium im the Fredrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark is designed as an inclusive sports facility. The stadium will hold 20,000 spectators and meet the requirements for play in the 3. Liga and 2. Bundesliga.[746][747][745] BFC Dynamo will be able to play matches at the new stadium. The new stadium in the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark is planned to be opened in 2028.[748]\\n\\nSupporters\\nEast German era\\nBFC Dynamo played only a minor role in football in Berlin until the relocation of FC Vorwärts Berlin to Frankfurt an der Oder in 1971.[717] The club initially had modest support, but with its growing successes in the 1970s, the club began to attract young fans, primarily from the central areas around the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark, such as Prenzlauer Berg and Mitte.[174] Many came from working class families in Prenzlauer Berg.[749] One of the first big supporter groups of BFC Dynamo was Black Eagle. The fan club was founded in 1972 and was one of the earliest fan clubs in East German football. Fans of BFC Dynamo were the first to sew their embroidered fan club badges on their jackets. This was a novelty among football supporters in East Germany in the 1970s.[750]\\n\\nThe supporter scene became a focal point for various subcultures in the late 1970s and beginning of the 1980s.[751][520][752] There were punks, rockers, hippies and a few early skinheads.[751][717][753][754][137] Some were left-leaning and others were right-leaning.[751][754] Football and stadium life offered free spaces that were difficult for the authorities to control.[137] For some fans, being part of the supporter scene was an opportunity to rebel against the East German regime.[751] Most supporters of BFC Dynamo had little to do with the state. It was more important for them to protest, do their own thing and break out from everyday life.[717] Despite cheering for a club associated with the Stasi, supporters of BFC Dynamo were not loyal to the line.[751] Many active fans of BFC Dynamo in the 1980s were against the regime.[177][754] Some supporters would even cut out the \\\"D\\\" for SV Dynamo from their club patches. They considered the \\\"BFC\\\" to be free from the Stasi, while they thought the \\\"D\\\" symbolized the exact opposite.[755]\\n\\n\\\"We provoked with chants and slogans. We were right, left, punk, hippie, skinhead. We were direct and provocative, kind and evil, in love, or drunk. Cool words were always well received. Right or left, I don\'t want to classify one. We were all in our fan group against the GDR, rebellion!\\\"\\n\\n– A fan of BFC Dynamo in the 1980s[756]\\nYoung people were gradually attracted by the provocative image of the club: its successes, its reputation as a Stasi club and the hatred of opposing fans.[520][752] Some fans of BFC Dynamo found delight in the unpopularity of their club and took pride in the hatred they met.[754][757][32] One fan recalled that the 1980s \\\"were my greatest years, as we always had glorious success in provoking other fans\\\" and another one that \\\"we were really hated by everyone\\\".[757] Fans of BFC Dynamo would sometimes respond to the hatred they met by singing chants in praise of Erich Mielke as a provocation.[758] They would also throw tropical fruits, that were only available in East Berlin, at home fans during away matches in Saxony.[178][753]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo came to be associated with areas such as Prenzlauer Berg, Pankow, Weißensee, Hohenschönhausen and certain cafés and restaurants in vicinity of Alexanderplatz.[759][760] The supporter scene included groups such as Black Eagle, Norbert Trieloff, Bobbys, Iron Fist, Beatles BFC Club, Die Ratten, Berliner Wölfe, Heavy Horses, Black Pahnter and Madness boys of Preussen in the 1980s.[761] Fashion played a big role in the BFC Dynamo supporter scene.[32][754] Football supporters in East Berlin shared a sense of superiority over their counterparts in the regional districts.[760][751] This was also the case with the supporters of Union Berlin, but notably with the supporters of BFC Dynamo.[760][762][177][763]\\n\\nFootball-related violence spread in East Germany in the 1970s.[137][764] The supporter scene of BFC Dynamo was still young at the time, while clubs such Union Berlin and BSG Chemie Leipzig had large followings.[32] A trip to Leipzig or Dresden was a difficult task.[717] Supporters of BFC Dynamo responded to the hostile environment, and learned to compensate their smaller numbers, by being more aggressive and better organized.[765][174][32][766] The dislike against BFC Dynamo in stadiums around the country and the hatred of opposing fans welded its supporters together.[767] One fan of BFC Dynamo said: \\\"This feeling of being hated is what makes it so appealing.\\\" A saying among the supporters of BFC Dynamo was: \\\"We are few, but we are awesome!\\\" (German: Wir sind wenig, wir sind geil!)[768][32] One fan of BFC Dynamo recalled: \\\"It was really rumbling at away trips, and only then you felt your own strength. When we went with 200 people against 1,000 Unioners and you noticed: If you stick together, you have an incredible amount of violence.\\\"[769] Supporters of BFC Dynamo would eventually gain a reputation for being particularly violent and organized.[174] One fan of Union Berlin recalled: \\\"There was hardly an enemy mob against us, we were just too many... But the people who stood in the way of the violence-seeking BFC:ers were very few... The BFC:ers were completely organized. These hundred and fifty people, everyone knew each other. They stood as a block like a wall.\\\"[770] The book \\\"Riot Boys!\\\" by Jochen Schramm depicts the supporter scene of BFC Dynamo and contains stories of violent away trips in the early 1980s. Jochen \\\"Ellis\\\" Schramm was a member of the hooligan scene of BFC Dynamo in the 1980s.[771]\\n\\nThe development in the supporter scene of BFC Dynamo would eventually catch the attention of the authorities. The Stasi conducted a study on the violent structures of the supporter scene at the beginning of the 1980s. It found that 80 percent of those committing violent acts were 16–25 years old. Most of them were workers or students.[760] It also found that 20 percent came from families of the socialist intelligentia.[177][760] The Stasi assigned a group of two full-time officers from the district administration to the supporter scene during 1982–83 season.[772] From then, supporters of BFC Dynamo were accompanied, observed and documented.[773] This was a measure that had previously also been applied to the supporter scene of Union Berlin.[178] The authorities had allegedly been particularly alarmed when supporters of BFC Dynamo unfurled a poster in memory of Lutz Eigendorf with the text \\\"Iron Foot, we mourn you!\\\" during a match at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark in April 1983.[774][773][174] Supporters had also started a fan club in honour of Eigendorf.[753] The Stasi would try to control the supporter scene with a broad catalogue of measures: persistent talks, intimidation attempts, reporting requirements and arrests.[717][751] It would also attempt to infiltrate the fan clubs by unofficial collaborators (IM).[772] All football fan clubs in East Germany had to undergo registration.[137] According to Stasi information, BFC Dynamo had six registered fan clubs and 22 unauthorized fan clubs in 1986. Unauthorized fan clubs were those that were unregistered or did not meet DFV guidelines.[775] East German state television always tryied to hide riots from viewers. But the sound recording from football matches was the biggest problem. Additional sound systems were integrated into the stadium of BFC Dynamo for radio and television broadcasts. The system was also supposed to drown out shouts and chanting from the violent structures, so that television viewers and radio listeners would not hear anything.[776]\\n\\nThe supporter scene of BFC Dynamo came to be increasingly associated with skinheads and far-right tendencies from the mid-1980s.[174] More and more supporters of BFC Dynamo began to embrace skinhead fashion in the early 1980s.[751][717] Skinhead fashion was now considered the most provocative outfit.[751] By the mid-1980s, the club had become one of the most popular football clubs in the growing skinhead movement.[32][nb 10] The reputation of BFC Dynamo as the hated Stasi club also attracted skinheads, who used the club as a stage for their provocations.[520] Right-wing slogans and fascist chants were considered as the most challenging provocations, as anti-fascism was state doctrine and Nazism officially did not exist in East Germany.[783][137][174][751][784][637] For young people, being a Nazi was sometimes considered the sharpest form of opposition.[785] However, instances of Nazi provocations did not necessarily reflect genuine political convictions. At least some part of the \\\"drift to the right\\\" among East German youth during the 1980s was rooted in a desire to position oneself wherever the state was not.[786] One fan of BFC Dynamo said: \\\"None of us really knew anything about politics. But to raise your arm in front of the Volkspolizei was a real kick. You did that and for some of them, their whole world just fell apart\\\".[787][717][174][nb 11]\\n\\nThe first East German hooligan group developed from the supporter scene of BFC Dynamo in the 1980s. The development was partly a response to the increasing state repression against the supporter scene, notably from the Stasi.[190] An organized hooligan scene with groups, structures and training rooms, that was unique in East Germany, would eventually emerge at BFC Dynamo.[766] The hooligans of BFC Dynamo initially reacted with restraint to police intervention in the fan block. There was a risk of going to jail. However, the Volkspolizei were sometimes ruthless, especially at away matches. Towards the end of the 1980s, there was an uprising and the hooligans of BFC Dynamo now began to confront the police with violence.[794] The final of the 1987-88 FDGB-Pokal between BFC Dynamo and Carl Zeiss Jena on 4 June 1988 saw some of the most serious violence ever witnessed at an East German football match.[4] A group of 100 to 150 skinheads and other hooligans marched through Pankow to the Stadion der Weltjugend for the match. They chanted fascist slogans and clashed with other supporters.[795][779] Riots then broke out in one of the blocks shortly before the end of the match. Supporters destroyed fences and threw seats at match stewards.[796] A group of 300 supporters of BFC Dynamo attempted to invade the pitch during the victory ceremony. They caused extensive damage to 60 seating benches.[786] About a year later, supporters of BFC Dynamo would also destroy large parts of a block of the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark, during the match against AS Monaco in the 1989–90 European Cup Winners\' Cup on 1 November 1989.[797][798][nb 12]\\n\\nGerman reunification\\nA wave of violence swept through the football stadiums of East Germany in 1990.[178] The collapse of the East German regime resulted in a security vacuum.[800][801][802] The Volkspolizei was overwhelmed by the amount of disorder and often reluctant to use enough force, due to the political situation.[803][178][804][264]\\n\\n\\nSupporters of FC Berlin during the away match against FC Carl Zeiss Jena on 8 April 1990.\\nMasked supporters of FC Berlin rioted in central Jena before the away match against FC Carl Zeiss Jena in the 1989-90 DDR-Oberliga on 8 April 1990. They broke shop windows, smashed windscreens of police vehicles with stones and left a trail of destruction in the city center. Supporters of FC Berlin also fired flares at police officers during the match.[805] The disorder at the stadium would not cease and the match was eventually interrupted.[32] The riots in Jena caught rare attention by East German state media, which until then had been generally silent about football related disorder.[32][751]\\n\\n\\nA flare thrown on the pitch during the match between FC Carl Zeiss Jena and FC Berlin on 8 April 1990.\\nThere were now riots now after every home match in FC Berlin. After the last home match in the 1989-90 NOFV-Oberliga against BSG Wismut Aue on 26 May 1990, a group of 300 supporters of FC Berlin marched from Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark towards Alexanderplatz. Windows were smashed, cars were damaged and a minibus was overturned as they made their way. Supporters met at the Marx-Engels-Forum. A group of 200 people then formed a human swastika in front of the Volkspolizei. There were 21 arrests, and the police seized knives, knuckle dusters and pepper spray.[806]\\n\\nHooligans who had left East Germany for various reasons in recent years rejoined the hooligan scene after the opening of the Berlin Wall.[265][807] Some were former skinheads who had been deported by the Stasi to West Germany in the late 1980s. Now they chanted things such as \\\"Who should be our Führer? Erich Mielke!\\\" as a provocative fun, to the dismay of the club.[265][804] Supporters who returned from West Germany also brought back a new fashion based on designer clothing labels and expensive sportswear, which was adopted by the supporter scene.[265][767] While combat boots and bomber jackets were now common at many places in East Germany, some supporters of BFC Dynamo wanted to differentiate themselves. Expensive sneakers was now the new fashion in the supporter scene.[717][807][808] Brands such as Diesel, Iceberg, Chevignon, Adidas, Best Company, New Balance and Ray Ban became popular.[767][265][808][760]\\n\\nThe reputation of the hooligans of FC Berlin attracted a large number of new young people who joined the hooligan scene.[265] A series of violence occurred in connection with the cup match between Union Berlin and FC Berlin in the Second round of the 1990-91 FDGB-Pokal on 23 September 1990. Hooligans of FC Berlin stormed the home stands of the Stadion an der Alten Försterei armed with clubs and flares and hunted down supporters of Union Berlin.[263][809] Riots broke out after match. Aound 250 hooligans threw gravel and other objects at the police. At least 14 police officers were injured in the clashes.[810] Serious riots then continued in the city, involving hundreds of supporters. Street battles broke out in areas of East Berlin, even spreading to Kreuzberg in West Berlin.[811] One supporter of FC Berlin said: \\\"In 1990, thanks to the many departures to the West, it became clear relatively quickly that there was no flowerpot to be won with the current team. We then turned our attention to other things.\\\"[812]\\n\\nHooligans in East Germany unleashed almost unbridled violence against the representatives of the disintegrating East German state.[802] Violent riots had occurred in Rostock, Dresden, Erfurt and East Berlin.[802] Police had been forced to shoot warning shots during violent riots in Leipzig and one match in the 1990-91 NOFV-Oberliga had already been abandoned due to riots in the stadium.[803][813][814][815][nb 13] The situation peaked during a match between FC Sachsen Leipzig and FC Berlin on 3 November 1990. Supporters of FC Berlin travelled in large numbers to Leipzig for the match.[802] The police had only 219 officers available for the match.[264] There were clashes at the Leipzig main railway station, with one police officer injured and 50 supporters taken into custody.[264][816] A first group of around 100 supporters of FC Berlin entered the Georg-Schwarz-Sportpark in time for kick-off.[802] They were joined by a hooligans of 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig, who had forced their way into the stadium.[817][818][819][777] Supporters of both camps tried to attack each other in the stadium and the police had difficulties in maintaining a buffer zone.[264] A second group of up to 400 supporters of FC Berlin arrived later at the nearby Leipzig-Leutzsch S-Bahn station at Am Ritterschlößchen street.[802][264] Fireworks were fired as they made their way to the stadium.[820] The group was blocked from entering the stadium by police equipped with helmets and shields, despite showing valid tickets.[821][822][265] The supporters were not given any reason.[820] They were then pushed back by the police using tear gas and truncheons.[802][264][821] The group returned to the S-Bahn station and made an attempt to reach the stadium from the Pettenkofer Straße instead.[802] They were again blocked by police who immediately used truncheons.[802][820]\\n\\nRiots broke out at the S-Bahn station.[802] The station building was vandalized and numerous cars were smashed or burned, including at least one W 50 police truck and one police car.[802][264][820][816] The police was allegedly outnumbered.[823][nb 14] Cobblestones were thrown at the police waiting at the Pettenkofer Straße.[802] The police now decided to use their firearms.[802] 18-year old supporter Mike Polley (de) from the locality of Malchow in Berlin was hit by several bullets and instantly killed.[265][807] He was allegedly about to bend down to a friend when hit.[826] Several others were injured and at least another three people were seriously injured.[801][264][821] One supporter of FC Berlin was hit in the head and suffered critical injuries, but survived.[265] The police had fired between 50 and 100 shots in about a minute, from 11 different police pistols.[264][821] Reports and sources vary on what happened on the scene and how the situation was.[264] The police claim that they were surrounded.[823] But this was rebuffed by an eyewitness.[820] Shots had been fired from distances as long as 30–40 meters.[264][820] The police had also fired at fleeing supporters.[820] One supporter was hit while trying to escape into an S-Bahn train.[820] Not every injured had come with the supporters of FC Berlin. Also an uninvolved woman was shot in the leg.[264]\\n\\nAfter the shootings, some supporters of FC Berlin left the S-Bahn station by train.[823] Many were shaken, but other wanted to take revenge.[820] A group of supporters stopped a tram, kicked the driver out and maneuvered it down town.[265][802] Riots now continued in central Leipzig, where policed presence was low.[820] The riots in central Leipzig continued for several hours and the damage was extensive.[265][802][777] Supporters of FC Berlin devastated entire streets.[823] All shop windows on the Nikolaistraße opposite the main railway station were broken.[816] There was rampage at the Park Hotel.[818][824] The ground floor of a department store on Brühl was destroyed.[824] Numerous cars were demolished and up to 31 shops were smashed and looted.[824][823][264] Supporters clashed with transport police at the main railway station. New shots were fired by the police, but no one was injured.[823][265][264]\\n\\n\\nSupporters of FC Berlin commemorate Mike Polley at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark, during the match against HFC Chemie in the 1990-91 NOFV-Oberliga on 10 November 1990.\\nMike Polley was considered a beginner in the supporter scene.[823] A demonstration against police violence with 1,000 participants was arranged in Prenzlauer Berg by supporters of FC Berlin after the match against HFC Chemie on 10 November 1990.[32][264][777] The demonstration was supported by the recently founded Fanprojekt Berlin.[264] Also professional FC Berlin players such as Waldemar Ksienzyk participated in the march.[257] The demonstration received support from politicians such as Lena Schraut from the Alternative List and from left-wing activists, notably from the occupied houses near Senefelderplatz at the Schönhauser Allee.[777][265] The friendly match between East Germany and West Germany that was planned to be held on the Zentralstadion in Leipzig on 21 November 1990 was cancelled for security reasons and due to the tense situation among football supporters after the shootings.[264][777] An investigation against ten police officers was opened, but closed in April 1992.[264][777] The exact circumstances around the death of Mike Polley were never fully clarified.[822][827]\\n\\nStadium attendance collapsed in 1990. Many supporters of BFC Dynamo stopped attending matches after the Peaceful revolution, as the best players were sold off to clubs in West Germany, sports performance slumped, tickets prices rose, mass unemployment spread and hooligans had come to dominate the stands.[178][801][637][828] Some shifted their focus to ice hockey instead.[829] The average league attendance of the 1990–91 NOFV-Oberliga was by far the lowest in the league history.[801] BFC Dynamo was hit particularly hard by the decline. Average league attendance at BFC Dynamo had dropped from 8,385 in the 1988–89 season to 1,076 in the 1990–91 season.[830][831][832] Ordinary supporters had disappeared. Only young supporters remained in the stadium at FC Berlin in 1990 and 1991.[178]\\n\\nThe violent faction of FC Berlin would come to shape the entire 1990–91 season.[265] Matches involving FC Berlin were all security matches.[264] A group of 500–600 supporters of FC Berlin travelled with a special train to Rostock for an away match against F.C. Hansa Rostock on 16 March 1991.[265][833] The police did not manage to control the situation despite a record strong presence of more than 600 officers.[833][834] Riots broke out in central Rostock, where supporters smashed shops, demolished cars and attacked people.[265][767][833] Supporters without tickets stormed the Ostseestadion and there were fights with supporters of F.C. Hansa Rostock around the stadium.[833] Riots at the train station after the match had to be suppressed by the police with tear gas and water cannons.[833][265] The damage was again extensive. Up to 17 shops at the Wismarischen Straße were smashed and looted, the train station was devastated and the special train was vandalized.[834] 21 people were injured in the clashes, including nine police officers.[835][836] The damages amounted to around 750,000 Deutsche Marks.[836] The Minister President of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern Alfred Gomolka believed the Stasi was behind the riots. He claimed that the hooligans of FC Berlin were controlled by \\\"Stasi remnants\\\" who wanted to cause \\\"destabilization\\\". Also the Interior Minister of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern Georg Diederich saw the riots as a political confrontation. As a proof, they pointed to the fact that supporters of FC Berlin came with East German flags and that the club had pre-financed the special train to Rostock.[835]\\n\\nThe youth television programme Elf99 on Deutscher Fernsehfunk (DFF) ran a special story on the hooligans of FC Berlin in August 1991. The story was called \\\"Elf-Spezial: Das randalierende Rätsel – Der Berliner Hooligans zwischen Wahn und Scham?\\\" and can be found on YouTube as of 2020.[837] About 200 supporters of FC Berlin traveled to the top match against Greifswalder SC 1926 in the 1991-92 NOFV-Oberliga Nord on 3 November 1991. Repeated riots broke out during the match. Supporters of FC Berlin claim they were insulted as \\\"Stasi-pigs!\\\" by spectators in Greifswald. Supporters of FC Berlin fought with other spectators and the stadium facilities were demolished in the riots.[838] Up to 100 hooligans of FC Berlin also attacked an asylum shelter that was located right next to the stadium in Greifswald.[839][840][788][841] SV Hafen Rostock 61 subsequently postponed its upcoming league match at home against FC Berlin for security reasons.[842][841]\\n\\nHooliganism\\nThe hooligan scene of FC Berlin at the beginning of the 1990s was considered the most notorious for years in Germany. Hooligans of FC Berlin were subsequently involved in numerous fights in stadiums, woods and meadows.[178] Organized fights with other hooligan groups began in 1992 and 1993.[265] However, hooligans of FC Berlin were also involved in fights with squatters and other left-wing groups in the 1990s.[265] 25 supporters of FC Berlin fought 40 people from the left-wing scene in front of a pub on the Straße der Pariser Kommune in Friedrichshain on 17 April 1995. Several people were injured.[843] A number of people allegedly associated with the hooligan scene of FC Berlin attacked formerly occupied houses and a meeting point for left-wing football supporters at Brunnenstraße 6 and 7 in Mitte on the night of 6 September 1997. A punk concert was held on the premises at the time. Four people had to be hospitalized with injuries.[844]\\n\\nIn the years after German reunification, the club\'s eternal outside image attracted people from the underground.[752] Playing for meager crowds in regional leagues, the club eventually became a meeting place for individuals from Berlin\'s far-right, hooligan and criminal underground.[637][845] By the mid-1990s, the hooligan scene of FC Berlin had developed a connection to the eastern Berlin bouncer scene.[387] The eastern Berlin bouncer scene would eventually be almost completely organized from the hooligan scene of BFC Dynamo.[799][846] One of those involved in the assault on French policeman Daniel Nivel during the 1998 FIFA World Cup had connections to the hooligan scene of FC Berlin.[637] The same man was later linked to organized crime and eventfully involved in a high-profile drug trafficking case.[847][848][637]\\n\\nThe match between BFC Dynamo and Berlin Türkspor 1965 in the final of the 1998–99 Berlin Cup on 11 May 1999 was marked by violence. Supporters of BFC Dynamo directed far-right chants and others provocations against Berlin Türkspor 1965 during the match.[849] 400 supporters of BFC Dynamo invaded the pitch after the final whistle to celebrate the title. Some supporters also attacked players of Berlin Türkspor 1965. Two players of Berlin Türkspor 1965 were injured, one of them had suffered a stab wound.[850] BFC Dynamo Club President Volkmar Wanski was able to prevent a total escalation by giving a calming speech over the stadium microphone.[851] He immediately apologized for the behavior of the supporters at the press conference after the match.[850] Older supporters of BFC Dynamo openly expressed their contempt for the far-right supporters that had visited the match.[852] BFC Dynamo and Berlin Türkspor 1965 agreed to meet in a friendly match later in the season and to organize a joint meal for players and responsible.[853] Wanski made it clear in the speakers ahead of the last home match against FC Rot-Weiß Erfurt in the 1998-99 Regionalliga Nordost on 15 May 1999 that \\\"anyone who cannot behave has no business in our stadium\\\".[854]\\n\\nSerious riots broke out in Prenzlauer Berg after the match between BFC Dynamo and 1. FC Union Berlin in the Round of 16 of the 2000–01 Berlin Cup at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark on 24 March 2001. Around 150 supporters of BFC Dynamo attacked the police after the match, as they wanted to storm the block of Union Berlin.[855][342] Around 500 supporters of BFC Dynamo then attacked police at Eberswalder Straße.[342] The police employed water cannons against supporters at Eberswalder Straße and Schönhauser Allee. Nine people, including four police officers, were injured.[855][342] BFC Dynamo Club President Karin Halsch (de) and 1. FC Union Berlin Club President Heiner Bertram criticized the police in unison for provocations during the match and for triggering riots.[341] Karin Halsch simultaneously expressed sadness that the riots destroyed a lot of reconstruction work in the club and announced that there would be many stadium bans.[341][856] Also coach Jürgen Bogs spoke out about \\\"senseless violence\\\" that would once again fall back on the club, but also criticized the police for provocations.[341] Many of those involved in the riots did not come from the supporter scene of BFC Dynamo. Many were visitors from other cities in Germany.[387]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo had the highest number of violent supporters in Germany in 2005.[857] Violence broke out during the match between Tennis Borussia Berlin and BFC Dynamo in the 2004-05 NOFV-Oberliga Nord at the Mommsenstadion on 11 February 2005. A flare was lit and a couple of bangers set off in the guest block at the beginning of the second half. Police then decided to intervene against away supporters. Police officers were pelted with beer cups and attacked by supporters of BFC Dynamo when they entered gest block. Eight police officers were injured and 11 supporters of BFC Dynamo arrested. BFC Dynamo criticized the police operation as \\\"disproportionate\\\".[858][431] Supporters of BFC Dynamo claimed that they had been called \\\"Nazis\\\", \\\"Ossis\\\" and \\\"Unioners\\\" by police officers. Riots had broken out also when Tennis Borussia Berlin played 1. FC Union Berlin in round of 16 of the 2004-05 Berlin Cup at the Mommsenstadion a couple of weeks before.[431]\\n\\nFighting between supporters of BFC Dynamo and police again broke out in connection with the match between BFC Dynamo and SV Yeşilyurt at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark on 24 April 2005. The mood had been tense during the match. The situation escalated when celebrating supporters of BFC Dynamo attacked the fence after the final whistle. Police intervened with water hoses, batons and tear gas against supporters of BFC Dynamo. Four police officers were injured and five hooligans arrested. One police officer suffered a broken nose and another one a concussion.[859][860] Riots again broke out in connection to a match between BFC Dynamo and SV Yeşilyurt at the opening of the 2005-06 NOFV-Oberliga Nord at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark 5 August 2005. The match was attended by 1,200 supporters of BFC Dynamo. Hooligans in the crowd threw bottles and stones at police officers during the match. Fights between hooligans and police then broke out after match. Around 150 hooligans had participated in the riots, according to police information.[861][438] BFC Dynamo spokesperson Yiannis Kaufmann claimed that those involved were a \\\"mob of travelling fans who wants to cause trouble everywhere and now discredit the BFC\\\".[861] As many as 13 police officers were injured in the riots.[439][440]\\n\\n\\nThe Stadion im Sportforum on 14 May 2006.\\nPolice made a controversial raid against the discotheque Jeton in Friedrichshain where supporters of BFC Dynamo and other people had gathered to celebrate in connection to a fan tournament in memory of Mike Polley on the night of 20 August 2005. The fan tournament had been visited by numerous teams, including teams from FC St. Pauli, 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig, Aberdeen F.C., VfL Bochum and Malmö FF.[862][863][864] The large-scale police operation involved 300 officers, including 100 members of the SEK.[865][866][867] 158 persons were arrested. Among the detainees were 19 Category C-supporters and 22 Category B-supporters.[439][866] Supporters filed numerous complaints against the police for use of excessive violence.[868] 39 people at the discotheque were injured.[440] Also bystanders were affected.[440] Police initially claimed they had been pelted with bottles and furnishings, but later corrected their statement and admitted that there had been no resistance.[865][440][439] The police had allegedly beaten defenseless people.[869] Police stated that the raid was a preventative measure on short notice to prevent hooligans from organizing for the upcoming match against Union Berlin on 21 August 2005.[440][866] There were speculations that police also took revenge for riots during the match between BFC Dynamo and SV Yeşilyurt at the opening of the season.[440][439] More than 1,000 police officers were deployed to the derby and the match was played without crowd trouble.[866][867] Banners in solidarity with the supporters of BFC Dynamo were displayed in 17 football stadiums across Germany during the following matchdays.[870]\\n\\nThe return match between BFC Dynamo and Union Berlin in the 2005–06 NOFV-Oberliga Nord was played at the Stadion im Sportforum on 13 May 2006. The standing was 1–1 when supporters of BFC Dynamo invaded the pitch in an attempt to storm the block of Union Berlin around the 75th minute.[871] Supporters of Union Berlin fled in panic.[872] The match was abandoned and Union Berlin was awarded a 2–0 win.[871][873] The players of BFC Dynamo wore the motto \\\"No power of violence\\\" on their shirts in the following match against BFC Preussen away on 17 May 2006.[874] The Stadion im Sportforum was temporarily closed for matches in the NOFV-Oberliga Nord after the riots.[457] The riots during the match against 1. FC Union Berlin threw the club into a financial crisis. Treasurer Sven Radicke concluded: \\\"Four years of our work were ruined in five minutes\\\".[459]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo has often attracted hooligans from outside, and hooligans who are otherwise not involved in the supporter scene, to high-profile matches.[520][875][530] The club has repeatedly complained about so-called \\\"riot tourists\\\".[530][876] Riots broke out after the match against Berliner AK 07 in the final of the 2009–10 Berlin Cup at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark on 2 June 2010. Around 100–150 supporters of BFC Dynamo attempted to invade the pitch after the final whistle.[519][875] Match stewards and players of BFC Dynamo threw themselves in to restrain supporters and prevent further riots.[519][877][875][520] One of them was goalkeeper Nico Thomaschewski, who later received an award from the Berlin Football Association (BFV) for his actions.[875] Polish fans of Pogoń Szczecin were allegedly linked to the riots.[875] Those who had invaded the pitch were whistled by other supporters of BFC Dynamo when they returned to the stands.[878]\\n\\nMajor riots then occurred after the match against 1. FC Kaiserslautern in the first round of the 2011-12 DFB-Pokal at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark on 3 July 2011.[528][529] Around 200–300 supporters of BFC Dynamo invaded the buffer zone and stormed the guest block after the match.[530][520] 18 police officers and many supporters from Kaiserslautern were injured in the attack.[520] The Chairman of the Economic Council Peter Meyer openly expressed his embarrassment and disappointment over the behavior of some supporters and publicly apologized.[530] There were allegations that hooligans outside the BFC Dynamo environment had been involved.[530] While the police stated that most of those arrested were from Berlin, the club claimed it had never seen most of the recent perpetrators before.[520]\\n\\nThe contemporary supporter scene\\nThe contemporary supporter scene contains various subcultures and categories of supporters. It ranges from older supporters to younger ultras.[749] Older supporters constitute an essential part of the supporter scene.[752] Many are active in the supporter group 79er.[875] The group is credited for its commitment to the club, notably the youth teams. Its members have been supporters of BFC Dynamo since the late 1970s.[875][717]\\n\\nThe supporter scene played an important part in saving the club from bankruptcy in 2001.[637] Supporters organized a demonstration against the impending bankruptcy. The demonstration marched from the Sportforum to the Rotes Rathaus where it was met by the former club president and SPD politician Karin Halsch.[368][369] Supporters threw parties and organized collections, made donations and travelled to countries such as Austria and Switzerland to convince creditors to accept smaller pay-offs in order to save the cub.[637] Supporters also installed bucket seats at the Stadion im Sportforum and built a new clubhouse in the Sportforum during the insolvency.[729][879] The insolvency crisis remains a defining moment for older supporters.[637] The supporter scene has traditionally arranged an annual Mike-Polley-Gedenkturnier, which is a football fan tournament in memory of Mike Polley.[822][880] The first edition of the fan tournament was arranged in the Sportforum Hohenschönhausen in 2003 and comprised 28 teams.[881] A march in memory of Mike Polley in Leipzig in 2018 was attended by 850 supporters of BFC Dynamo.[882]\\n\\nNew groups of younger ultra-oriented supporters have emerged since the 2000s.[875][717] Supporter group Fraktion H was founded in 2006 by younger supporters who wanted to create more atmosphere in the stadium.[875][717] A minor ultras scene then emerged with the founding of supporter group Ultras BFC in 2011. The ultras of BFC Dynamo have initiated campaigns such as \\\"Brown is not Claret\\\" and have also engaged in football tournaments for refugees.[845][717][883][608] The club has encouraged the new groups of younger supporters and club management has taken a stand against racism and right-wing extremism.[884][883][608] Fraktion H maintains a friendship with the supporters of Eintracht Trier, while members of the now dissolved Ultras BFC have had contacts with the ultras of Swedish football club GAIS.[885]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo is affiliated with Fanprojekt Berlin, which is an independent organization that engages in socio-pedagogical fan work.[752][886] The organization supports young fans in various aspects of life and aims at promoting a positive supporter culture.[886] BFC Dynamo engages in active fan work and has taken measures to control violent elements, to exclude known violators and to distance itself from radical supporters.[752][530][883] Far-right symbols and slogans are not tolerated by the club.[752] The Chairman of the Economic Council, Peter Meyer, stated publicly in connection with a friendly match against Hertha BSC in 2007 that the club did not want people who cannot follow the rules and that \\\"anyone who shouts Nazi slogans will be thrown out of the stadium\\\".[495] Lawyer and former Vice President of BFC Dynamo René Lau said in an interview with Deutsche Welle in 2019: \\\"If you had asked me 25 years ago [if BFC had a problem with Nazis], I would have said yes. But is today\'s BFC Dynamo a Nazi club? I would vehemently dispute that.\\\"[637] A large number of stadium bans has been issued by the club since the mid-2000s.[887][530] A total of 40 stadium bans was issued only in 2006.[888][887] No riots has occurred since 2011.[752]\\n\\nThe contemporary supporter scene has includes groups such as 79er, Mythos BFC, Fraktion H, Piefkes, Ultras BFC, East Company, Riot Sport, Black Boys Dynamo, Bärenbande, Gegengerade, Hipstercrew, Märkische Jungs, Sektion Süddeutschland and Banda Invicta.[875][889][717][890] Supporter group Gegengerade is a left wing-oriented fan club.[890] A number of supporters BFC Dynamo had been members of the \\\"Anti-Fascist Football Fan Initiative\\\" (AFFI) aleady back in 1993.[891][892] Supporters of BFC Dynamo have occasionally displayed a Norwegian flag with the text \\\"Thanks Norway\\\", in memory of Norway\'s 2–0 win over Nazi Germany in the quarter-finals of the 1936 Summer Olympics. Another banner that has occasionally been displayed at the stadium contains the text \\\"There Is A Light That Never Goes Out\\\", with reference to the 1980s British cult band The Smiths.[893]\\n\\nUltras BFC announced its dissolution on 23 January 2023, after the group had lost essential material in an attack. An individual in the group was attacked by a group of people in front of his private residence and robbed of essential group material. The group apologized to the supporter scene of BFC Dynamo and consequently dissolved, but at the same time announced that this was not the end.[894] The attack has been traced to Cottbus.[895] A new supporter group named Banda Invicta eventually presented itself with a banner and a coreography on the first matchday of the 2023-24 Regionalliga Nordost on 29 July 2023. The coreography read \\\"On to a new chapter\\\".[896]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo had 100 Category C and 190 Category-B supporters in 2019.[897] Younger hooligans of BFC Dynamo have contacts with supporter group Kaliber 030 at Hertha.[637][898] 20–25 supporters of BFC Dynamo joined Hertha in the guest block of the Stadion an der Alten Försterei during the derby between Union Berlin and Hertha on 2 November 2019.[899] Older hooligans of BFC Dynamo, on the other hand, maintain friendly relationships with like-minded supporters of 1. FC Magdeburg.[637] Supporters of BFC Dynamo wanted to travel in numbers to the return leg against VfB Oldenburg in the promotion play-offs for the 3. Liga on 4 June 2022. Up to 2,500 supporters of BFC Dynamo wanted to join the team in Oldenburg.[900] Around 1,300 supporters of BFC Dynamo was eventually admitted to the Marschweg-Stadion, where they marked their presence with a banner, a scarf choreography and flares.[901][902][903]\\n\\nOne of the most well-known books in Germany about the supporter scene of BFC Dynamo is \\\"Der BFC war schuld am Mauerbau\\\" by German author Andreas Gläser (de). The book was first published in 2002 and describes the supporter scene from the late 1970s and forward. The club, its reputation and supporter scene, was also the theme of stage play \\\"Dynamoland\\\" by Gudrun Herrbold. The play was set up in 2007 and involved young football players from BFC Dynamo as well as Andreas Gläser.[784][520][904] The fanzine \\\"Zugriff\\\" is dedicated to BFC Dynamo. The fanzine has been produced by Andreas Gläser and members of supporter group Gegengerade since 2008.[905] The tenth and latest issue was published in 2014. The tenth issue came with as music CD mixed by Andreas Gläser. The CD included numerous ska and punk tracks as well as a 25 seconds long recording of Erich Mielke ranting about skinheads and punks.[749]\\n\\nMusicians from German rock band Klaus Renft Combo composed the anthem \\\"Auf, Dynamo!\\\" for BFC Dynamo in 1999.[906] German rap musician Joe Rilla has also dedicated a song to BFC Dynamo. The song is called \\\"Heb die Faust Hoch (BFC Dynamo Straßenhymne)\\\" and was released in 2008. Joe Rilla, whose real name is Hagen Stoll (de), has a background in the hooligan scene of BFC Dynamo.[907] The clothing store Hoolywood on Schönhauser Allee in Prenzlauer Berg is associated with the supporter scene of BFC Dynamo. The store was founded at the beginning of the 1990s.[752][904][908] The store has been an advertising partner of BFC Dynamo.[909]\\n\\nRivalries\\nSG Dynamo Dresden\\nThe oldest rival of BFC Dynamo is SG Dynamo Dresden. The rivalry dates back to 1954 when the team of Dynamo Dresden and its place in the DDR-Oberliga was transferred to SC Dynamo Berlin during the course of the 1954-55 season. The relocation aroused a sense of victimhood among the fans of Dynamo Dresden which would later be compounded by the successes of BFC Dynamo.[758] Matters were exacerbated when additional players of Dynamo Dresden were delegated to Dynamo Berlin by the German Football Association of the GDR (DFV) following the relegation of Dynamo Dresden after the 1962–63 season.[910] The antagonism between the two clubs was underpinned by a historical German rivalry between Prussian Berlin and Saxony.[719][911] It was fueled by contemporary resentment in Dresden at the better provision of housing and consumer goods in the East German capital.[719] East Berliners were generally unpopular outside the city limits, especially in the southern regional districts of East Germany. They were considered arrogant and clearly preferred.[751]\\n\\nDynamo Dresden slowly recovered from the relocation. The club was declared a regional district center of excellence (German: Leistungszentrum) by the regional district board of the DTSB on 5 August 1968.[912][913] The club could now draw on the best players in Bezirk Dresden.[912] Dynamo Dresden eventually re-established itself in the DDR-Oberliga and became campions once again in the 1970-71 DDR-Oberliga. BFC Dynamo and Dynamo Dresden then met in the final of the 1970-71 FDGB-Pokal. Klaus Sammer scored 1-0 for Dynamo Dresden, but Norbert Johannsen equalized on a penalty. Dynamo Dresden eventually won the match 2-1 after a second goal by Sammer in extra time.[57] Dynamo Dresden thus secured the first Double in the history of East German football.[914] However, BFC Dynamo did not go completely empty-handed from the final. The team qualified for its first UEFA competition as runners-up. Its participation in the 1971–72 European Cup Winners\' Cup would be a success.\\n\\n\\nA duel between Harald Schütze (left) and Reinhard Häfner of Dynamo Dresden (right) during a match between BFC Dynamo and Dynamo Dresden in the DDR-Oberliga in 1976.\\nBFC Dynamo met Dynamo Dresden away on the sixth matchday of the 1974-75 DDR-Oberliga on 21 September 1974. The standing was 2–2 at the end of the match, after an equalizer from Norbert Johannsen on a penalty. Shortly before the final whistle, referee Robert Pischke from Rostock awarded Dynamo Dresden a controversial penalty. Siegmar Wätzlich converted the penalty and Dynamo Dresden won the match 3–2.[915][916] The East German football weekly Die neue Fußballwoche (FuWo) commented: \\\"Shortly before the end, the same thing on the other side, but this one surprised even the objective Dresdeners about it. They hadn\'t seen any opposing influence on the falling Richter... The Berliners exploded in outrage at the penalty kick, which snatched a point from them in the last minute.\\\"[916] Dynamo Dresden finished the season in third place, two points ahead of BFC Dynamo. BFC Dynamo finished the season in fourth place, but with a better goal difference. Dynamo Dresden had thus captured the place in the 1975-76 UEFA Cup narrowly ahead of BFC Dynamo. Referee Pischke was not selected for any more DDR-Oberliga matches and eventually chose to end his refereeing career.[917] He would years later become the president of F.C. Hansa Rostock.[918]\\n\\nDynamo Dresden would come to dominate East German football in the 1970s. The team managed to capture a third consecutive league title in the 1977–78 DDR-Oberliga. What happened after is subject to various rumors. Formal title celebrations took place in June 1978 at the hotel and restaurant Bastein at Prager Straße in Dresden. Erich Mielke paid a visit as the president of SV Dynamo to congratulate the team to the title. Dynamo Dresden player Reinhard Häfner recalls how Mielke held a speech where he said that he would be happier if BFC Dynamo was champions. Mielke should have added that \\\"since BFC Dynamo is also SV Dynamo, the title stays in the family, so to speak, and that is good too\\\". According to other versions of the same event, he allegedly proclaimed that everything will be done so that in the coming year, the champion will come from Berlin, and that it was now the turn of the BFC Dynamo.[919][920][921][922][nb 15]\\n\\n\\nThomas Doll and defending Matthias Döschner of Dynamo Dresden during a match between Dynamo Dresden and BFC Dynamo in 1987.\\nBFC Dynamo stood out among other clubs within SV Dynamo. The club was located at the frontline of the Cold War. It was also a representative of the capital of East Germany. This meant that the club had to be well equipped.[67] BFC Dynamo would come to benefit from a nationwide scouting system, supported by 33 training centers (TZ) of SV Dynamo across East Germany.[68][927] No less than 40 full-time trainers worked for the club.[928] The team embarked on a period of unparalleled success in the 1978–79 season under young coach Jürgen Bogs. Dynamo Dresden had been the dominant team in East German football until then. BFC Dynamo would now be its main obstacle to success.[nb 16]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo opened the 1978-79 DDR-Oberliga with ten consecutive wins. The team thus broke the previous record of Dynamo Dresden of seven consecutive wins from the 1972-73 DDR-Oberliga. Dynamo Dresden, on the other hand, had a moderately successful start to the season and stood in second place. The two teams met in the 11th matchday in front of 33,000 spectators at Dynamo-Stadion in Dresden on 2 December 1978.[934] The match ended in a draw 1-1 after an equalizer by Hans-Jürgen Riediger for BFC Dynamo. The match was marked by crowd trouble, with 38 fans to both teams arrested.[4] 17 of the 38 fans arrested were fans of BFC Dynamo.[935] Inexperienced linesman Günter Supp should allegedly have missed an offside position on Riediger in the situation leading up to the equalizer.[936][937] There were accusations in Dresden that the match had been manipulated by the referees in favor of BFC Dynamo.[4][180][201] This alleged manipulation was cited as yet another example of discrimination against the Saxon city in comparison with East Berlin.[4][180] BFC Dynamo continued to lead the league for the rest of the season. The team finally secured its first DDR-Oberliga title after defeating Dynamo Dresden 3–1 in the 24th match day in front of 22,000 spectators at Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark on 6 June 1979.[938]\\n\\nThe 1979-80 DDR-Oberliga would be tight race between the two rivals. Dynamo Dresden led the league for most of the season. Dynamo Dresden was still in first place before the last matchday. However, BFC Dynamo was only one point behind. The two rivals met at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark in the last matchday of the league season on 10 May 1980. Dynamo Dresden only needed a draw to win the league title. There was huge excitement around the match and the stadium was sold out. Die neue Fußballwoche (FuWo) reported on \\\"international match atmosphere\\\".[939] The standing was 0-0 for a long time. Dynamo Dresden player Peter Kotte fell in the BFC Dynamo penalty area with about 15 minutes left of regular time, but Dynamo Dresden was denied a penalty.[940] Norbert Trieloff instead scored a goal for BFC Dynamo just a moment later. BFC Dynamo eventually won the match 1-0 and captured its second consecutive league title in front of 30,000 spectators. Dynamo Dresden would not come this close to BFC Dynamo in the league until the end of the 1980s. It was rumoured that referee Hans Kulicke from Oderberg had favored BFC Dynamo. However, also BFC Dynamo had been denied a chance to decide the match. A goal by Hartmut Pelka had been disallowed by referee Kulicke due to a foul on Dynamo Dresden goalkeeper Bernd Jakubowski.[921]\\n\\nBoth clubs were affiliated to SV Dynamo and supported by the security organs. However, BFC Dynamo was more associated with the Stasi, while Dynamo Dresden was more associated with the Volkspolizei.[941] BFC Dynamo was known as the favourite club of the head of the Stasi Erich Mielke.[942] Dynamo Dresden, on the other hand, was patronaged by Volkspolizei Lieutenant general Willi Nyffenegger. Nyffenegger was the long-time head of the regional district authority of the Volkspolizei in Bezirk Dresden.[943] However, also Dynamo Dresden had supporters in the Stasi. The Stasi had helped Dynamo Dresden to obtain secret information about the line-up of FC Bayern Munich before the match between Dynamo Dresden and FC Bayern Munich in the 1973–74 European Cup on 7 November 1973.[944] Dynamo Dresden would also be supported by Stasi Major general Horst Böhm in the 1980s.[945] Böhm was the head of the regional district administration of the Stasi in Bezirk Dresden.[946][947][758] He was a committed local patriot when it came to Dynamo Dresden and a sponsoring member of the club.[948][947][949] The antagonism between the two clubs also spread to the Stasi Guards Regiment \\\"Felix E. Dzerzhinsky\\\".[719][4] The behavior of members of a Dresden unit during a match between the two teams in 1985 was likened to that of \\\"rioting fans\\\" by another Stasi officer.[719] Some Stasi guards had hurled abuse at BFC Dynamo players, shouting \\\"Bent champions!\\\" as they left the pitch.[758]\\n\\nResentment in Dresden over the rise of BFC Dynamo was worsened when three top players of Dynamo Dresden, Gerd Weber, Peter Kotte and Matthias Müller, were arrested on suspicion of planning to defect to West Germany in 1981.[950][4] Weber had solicited plans to defect, but the other two had not.[951] Weber received a prison sentence and a lifetime ban from playing football at any level in East Germany, while Kotte and Müller received lifetime bans from playing in the top two tiers for alleged complicity.[950][4][952] Neither would return to the Oberliga. The punishment against the three players led to rumors and protests in Dresden.[950] They also fueled local patriotism and anti-Berlin sentiments in Dresden.[950]\\n\\nFans of Dynamo Dresden saw the lifetime bans on Weber, Kotte and Müller as \\\"an order from Erich Mielke\\\" designed to weaken Dynamo Dresden.[950] Also, Kotte and Klaus Sammer has claimed they were part of a delibate plan by Mielke to weaken Dynamo Dresden.[953][954] However, such claims are doubtful.[953] The three players had been reported by an unofficial collaborator (IM) and Mielke was convinced that all three were originally prepared to defect.[951][953] Kotte was not an isolated case. The great fear of footballers, fans and officials who had fled East Germany was omnipresent at the Stasi.[955] Kotte and Müller knew about the intentions of Weber.[950] Their failure to inform authorities was critical.[950] Former SED First Secretary in Bezik Dresden Hans Modrow concludes that the measures against the three were \\\"generally cautious\\\", given the completely different consequences for other East German citizens in similar contexts. After all, the three were also members of the armed organs (German: Bewaffnete Organe der DDR) with ranks.[956] Müller said in an interview with Dresdner Neueste Nachrichten in 2011 that he \\\"knew one hundred percent\\\" that the uncompromising actions against the three players were a deliberate attempt by the Stasi to weaken Dynamo Dresden in order to secure the supremacy of BFC Dynamo.[957]\\n\\n\\nBFC Dynamo midfielder Bernd Schulz celebrates a goal against Dynamo Dresden in the DFV-Supercup together with Thomas Doll (left) and Jörg Fügner (right) in 1989.\\nBFC Dynamo and Dynamo Dresden would be the two main contenders for titles in East German football during the 1980s. BFC Dynamo dominated the DDR-Oberliga and won consecutive titles, while Dynamo Dresden had major success in the FDGB-Pokal. The two teams met in the 1981-82 FDGB-Pokal and 1983-84 FDGB-Pokal final. Dynamo Dresden won both finals and thus stopped BFC Dynamo from completing the Double.[940] The teams then also met in the 1984-85 FDGB-Pokal final. The performance of the referees in the final was controversial. A review by the DFV found that 30 percent of the referee decisions during the match had been wrong, and that 80 percent of those had been of disadvantage to Dynamo Dresden.[958] Referee Manfred Roßner was banned one year from officiating matches above second tier after the final.[959][960][958] However, nothing emerged that indicated that Roßner had been bought by the Stasi.[961] Dynamo Dresden won the final 3–2 in front of 48,000 spectators at the Stadion der Weltjugend. It was the fourth loss for BFC Dynamo against Dynamo Dresden in the final of the FDGB-Pokal and the third time that Dynamo Dresden had stopped the team from completing the Double.[940] However, BFC Dynamo would eventually succeed in completing the Double in the 1987–88 season, defeating FC Carl Zeiss Jena 2–0 in final of the 1987–88 FDGB-Pokal.\\n\\nDisturbances by spectators was a regular occurrence at matches between the two teams.[758] BFC Dynamo was met by immense hostility during away matches in Dresden. Fans of BFC Dynamo would respond to the hatred they met by singing chants in praise of Erich Mielke as a provocation.[758][178] They also made fun of the food shortage in Dresden.[753] Fans of BFC Dynamo are known to have brought coveted tropical fruits, that were only available in East Berlin, to away matches in Saxony. The fruits were then thrown at the home crowd.[178][753][751][nb 17] In Dresden they threw green bananas at the home fans and shouted: \\\"We brought you something - Bananas, bananas!\\\".[753] East German state television would always try to hide riots from viewers and sound engineers also had to drown out chants that were considered negative, such as \\\"Stasi out\\\". The match between BFC Dynamo and SG Dynamo Dresden was the most explosive encounter. At one point, the match between BFC Dynamo and SG Dynamo Dresden was even ordered to be recorded completely without sound.[776] A group of about 250 hooligans of Dynamo Dresden chanted anti-Semitic slogans against BFC Dynamo, such as \\\"Berlin Jews!\\\" and \\\"Jews\' sow!, during the match between the two teams in the 1987-88 DDR-Oberliga in East Berlin on 6 April 1988.[792][963] A number of supporters of SG Dynamo Dresden were then allegedly arrested after the match.[963]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo\'s ten-year dominance in the league was eventually broken by Dynamo Dresden in the 1988–89 season. BFC Dynamo won a second consecutive cup title in the 1988-89 FDGB-Pokal, but Dynamo Dresden became the new champion in the 1988-89 DDR-Oberliga. BFC Dynamo and Dynamo Dresden then met in the first ever DFV-Supercup in 1989. BFC Dynamo won the match 4–1 in front of 22,347 spectators at the Stadion der Freundschaft in Cottbus and became the first and only winner of the DFV-Supercup in the history of East German football.\\n\\nBFC Dynamo and Dynamo Dresden met 60 times in the Oberliga, FDGB-Pokal and DFV-Supercup between 1966 and 1991. BFC Dynamo won 21 matches and Dynamo Dresden won 27 matches. BFC Dynamo and Dynamo Dresden also met 10 times in the Regionalliga Nordost between 1995 and 2000. BFC Dynamo won 3 matches and Dynamo Dresden won 5 matches. The last meeting ended 1–1 and took place in the 1999-00 Regionalliga Nordost on 26 April 2000. The two teams rarely meet these days, because Dynamo Dresden regularly appears in the second or third tier of the German football league system. Former Dynamo Dresden player Ralf Minge expressed in an interview in 2018 his satisfaction that Dynamo Dresden has advanced past BFC Dynamo, but also said that he would not mind new duels with BFC Dynamo and that duels with BFC Dynamo \\\"have a certain charm\\\".[964]\\n\\n1. FC Union Berlin\\nFurther information: Berlin derby\\nBFC Dynamo and 1. FC Union Berlin were founded only a few days apart. Both clubs were formed during the reorganization of East German football in December 1965 and January 1966, when the football departments of ten sports clubs (SC) were reorganized into dedicated football clubs.[965] However, Union Berlin was not part of the original plan. Two football clubs had already been planned for East Berlin. They were to be formed from the football departments of SC Dynamo Berlin and ASK Vorwärts Berlin.[64] In addition, TSC Berlin played only in the second tier DDR-Liga at the time.[965][64] The founding of Union Berlin probably owed much to the intervention of the powerful Herbert Warnke.[965][762][966] Herbert Warnke was the chairman of the national state trade union FDGB and a member of the SED Politburo.[965] Dynamo Berlin and Vorwärts Berlin were both associated with the armed and security organs.[965][64] Herbert Warnke therefore argued for the formation of a civilian club for the working people of East Berlin.[965][64] He would be a passionate fan of Union Berlin.[967] Another high-ranking SED politician who pushed for the founding a civilian football club in East Berlin was the SED First Secretary in East Berlin and SED Politburo member Paul Verner.[968] Verner held a speech at the founding ceremony of Union Berlin.[969]\\n\\nBoth BFC Dynamo and Union Berlin belonged to the elite in East German football.[762][970] The new football clubs were intended as centers of excellence, with the right to draw on talents within designated geographical areas.[4][64] BFC Dynamo was supported by the Stasi, while Union Berlin was supported by the FDGB.[971][972][nb 18] However, Union Berlin was able to trace its origins back to FC Olympia Oberschöneweide in 1906.[753] BFC Dynamo had no history before East Germany. The supporters of Union Berlin therefore considered their club to be a genuine football club, unlike BFC Dynamo.[762] However, even as a civilian club, Union Berlin was also part of the sports political system.[177][975][65] The founding of the Union Berlin was organized by the then SED First Secretary in Köpenick Hans Modrow.[976] Like Herbert Warnke, Hans Modrow would be a sponsoring member of the club.[971][976] The most important positions on the board of Union Berlin were exclusively held by directors of state-owned factories or SED representatives.[65] Union Berlin was state-funded and all decisions in club had to be reported to the all-powerful central sports agency DTSB.[975] The DTSB stood in turn under direct control of the SED Central Committee.[977]\\n\\nThe rivalry between BFC Dynamo and Union Berlin began in the mid-1960s. It was initially based on the geographical proximity to each other.[66] BFC Dynamo and Union Berlin were two clubs from East Berlin in the DDR-Oberliga.[66] BFC Dynamo struggled in the 1966-67 DDR-Oberliga and was threatened with relegation. The feud between the two clubs began when fans of Union Berlin mocked BFC Dynamo with a banner saying \\\"We greet the relegated\\\" during a league match at the Stadion an der Alten Försterei on 26 April 1967.[45][972] Union Berlin won the match by 3–0 and BFC Dynamo was eventually relegated to the DDR-Liga at the end of the season.[45] While BFC Dynamo was playing in the second tier DDR-Liga, Union Berlin surprisingly won the 1967–68 FDGB-Pokal.[762] However, BFC Dynamo immediately bounced back and managed to establish itself in the DDR-Oberliga. Union Berlin would then itself be relegated to the DDR-Liga after the 1968-69 DDR-Oberliga, but also managed to return to the DDR-Oberliga after just one season in the second tier. Union Berlin would be the stronger of the two teams until the 1970s.[978]\\n\\nThe rivalry between the two clubs intensified in the early 1970s.[66] The player of Union Berlin, Klaus Korn, was suspended after a heated derby in the 1970–71 DDR-Oberliga at the Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum on 28 October 1970.[66][45] The performance of the referees had been \\\"catastrophic\\\" according to private notes from the then Second Club Secretary and Vice President of Union Berlin Günter Mielis, and the match ended with riots.[66][979][980] Klaus Korn had insulted players in BFC Dynamo with slurs such as \\\"Stasi-pig\\\". The DFV Legal Commission imposed a one-year ban on Klaus Korn after a circumstantial trial.[981][982] The DFV Legal Commission also demanded that Union Berlin considered his exclusion from the club. Klaus Korn was then excluded from the club and would never play in the DDR-Oberliga again.[981][982][66][45] Unrest broke out again at a derby in Hohenschönhausen one year later. Eight spectators were arrested after the match between BFC Dynamo and Union Berlin in the 1971–72 DDR-Oberliga at the Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum on 28 December 1971.[983] The match was attended by 14,000 spectators and the stadium was sold out.[984][712]\\n\\nThe football landscape in East Berlin changed before the 1971–72 season. Vorwärts Berlin was relocated to Frankfurt an der Oder on 31 July 1971. BFC Dynamo and Union Berlin were from now on the only major football clubs in East Berlin.[985] The relocation meant that BFC Dynamo could now take over the role of the dominant team for the armed organs in East Berlin. The team would also have opportunity to eventually move into the larger and more centrally located Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark, which led to increased interest in the club and growing attendance numbers.[66] The districts in East Berlin had previously been divided between BFC Dynamo, Vorwärts Berlin and Union Berlin. Each club was able to recruit young players from training centers (TZ) in their districts.[64][65] All training centers that had previously belonged to Vorwärts Berlin were now given to BFC Dynamo.[64][65] The DTSB allegedly saw more potential in BFC Dynamo.[64] BFC Dynamo now had access to two thirds of all training centers (TZ) in East Berlin.[65][35] This meant that BFC Dynamo had gained a much stronger position in East Berlin than Union Berlin when it came to recruiting young players.[978] FC Vorwärts Frankfurt was given Bezirk Potsdam as a catchment area, in addition to Bezirk Frankfurt. Bezirk Potsdam had previously been assigned to Union Berlin and thus had to be handed over to Vorwärts Frankfurt. This further weakened Union Berlin in relation to BFC Dynamo.[986][65][nb 19]\\n\\nUnion Berlin was relegated to the DDR-Liga after the 1972–73 season. The Union Berlin star and national team player Reinhard Lauck was transferred to BFC Dynamo after the relegation.[987] The loss of Lauck was a hard blow for the team. Lauck had contributed greatly to the victory in the final of the 1967–68 FDGB-Pokal and was well-liked among the supporters of Union Berlin.[987] Supporters of Union Berlin are said to have gathered outside his apartment, to appeal to him to stay in the team and play in the second tier.[988][989] But Lauck had already decided to change team.[988][990] The DFV had allegedly advised him to switch to BFC Dynamo in order to continue playing in the national team.[987] According to a regulation in the 1970 DFV Football Resolution (German: DFV-Fußballbeschluss), national team players in clubs that had been relegated from the DDR-Oberliga should switch clubs in order to remain competitive.[991] Lauck would make a successful appearance for East Germany in the 1974 FIFA World Cup and would win gold with East Germany in the 1976 Summer Olympics.[987][989] Lauck became the team captain of BFC Dynamo in the 1974–75 season.[82] He would later win two league titles with BFC Dynamo before ending his career due to a knee injury.[989][992]\\n\\nUnion Berlin would remain in the DDR-Liga for several seasons. Instead of playing matches against BFC Dynamo in the DDR-Oberliga, the team was now left to compete with the reserve team of BFC Dynamo, the BFC Dynamo II. Union Berlin would also suffer more blows which further weakened its position in relation to BFC Dynamo. Herbert Warnke passed in 1975 and was replaced as chairman of the FDGB by Harry Tisch.[971] Harry Tisch had begun his political career in Rostock and chose instead to give the support of the FDGB to F.C. Hansa Rostock.[971] Union Berlin thus lost the support of the FDGB and also no longer had any support in the top of the political hierarchy.[993] From no on, the club could only rely on support from the district administration of the SED in East Berlin and local state-owned enterprises, such as VEB Kabelwerk Oberspree (KWO) and VEB Transformatorenwerk Oberschöneweide (TRO).[994][971]\\n\\nThe DTSB and the DFV had also continued their efforts to concentrate resources on a few clubs during the 1970s.[995] A number of football clubs became specially promoted focus clubs in the 1970 DFV Football Resolution.[60][996] The focus clubs were meant to be strengthened through player transfers. Players in teams that had been relegated from the DDR-Oberliga should also switch to focus clubs.[997] The focus clubs were also equipped with more staff as well as better material and technical conditions.[998][60][996] BFC Dynamo became the focus club in East Berlin.[999][1000][995][nb 20] Even more advantages were then given to the focus clubs in the 1976 DFV Football Resolution. The focus clubs would now be allowed to delegate youth players from other football clubs. They would also be provided with more youth coaches from the DFV and have the right to accommodate twice as many students in their affiliated Children and Youth Sports Schools (KJS) every year, compared to other football clubs.[1001][999][1002] Union Berlin would now have to delegate some of its best young players to BFC Dynamo.[978][nb 21] One example was the talented Detlef Helms, who was delegated to BFC Dynamo as a 17-year-old in 1977.[65][970]\\n\\nUnion Berlin returned to the Oberliga in the 1976–77 season. Stadion an der Alten Försterei was a small football stadium without cinder tracks where the crowd stood close to the pitch.[762][990] Union Berlin had become the focus of hooligan attention.[719] Matches at the Stadion an der Alten Föresterei had regularly been interrupted by spectators throwing objects on the pitch.[1003] The derby between BFC Dynamo and Union Berlin was now such as heated affair that the matches were moved by the DFV to the neutral Stadion der Weltjugend in Mitte.[1004] It was considered that safety could not be guaranteed with the larger number of spectators.[1005][1006][719][762] The Stadion an der Alten Försterei was known for its atmosphere and the Stadion der Weltjugend was located only a few minutes away from the home district of BFC Dynamo.[990][66] The move was therefore seen as a major disadvantage by the fans to Union Berlin and further diluted their aversion to BFC Dynamo.[45][66][nb 22] Union Berlin defeated BFC Dynamo 1–0 in front of 45,000 spectators at the Stadion der Weltjugend in the first meeting of the 1976–77 season on 4 September 1976.[1008][294][95] Union Berlin also won the return match on 19 February 1977.[95] The two wins against BFC Dynamo during the 1976–77 season cemented the reputation of Union Berlin as a cult club and crowd puller.[1009]\\n\\nBFC Dynamo established itself as one of the top teams in the DDR-Oberliga from the mid-1970s. Union Berlin would come to play second fiddle in East Berlin from now on and never finish higher than seventh place in the DDR-Oberliga.[1010] In the shadow of BFC Dynamo, Union Berlin would no longer have any major sporting significance in East Germany.[1011] Union Berlin became a yo-yo team that hovered between the Oberliga and the DDR-Liga.[1010] Supporters of Union Berlin saw BFC Dynamo as the highest representative of the security organs and the police, with privileges in player recruitment and financial support as well as the political clout of Mielke.[762] This was supposedly in contrast to their own club, which they regarded as an underdog rooted in the working class.[762][719][1012][753] BFC Dynamo would be disliked all over East Germany for its successes and its connection to the Stasi.[910][137][38] This was also reflected in the derby between BFC Dynamo and Union Berlin.[137] The supporters of Union Berlin were seen as oppositional.[137] This is illustrated in the famous sentence of the editor-in-chief of the satirical magazine Eulenspiegel: \\\"Not all Union fans are enemies of the state, but all enemies of the state are Union fans.\\\"[137][1013] But the fact that people supported Union Berlin did not automatically mean that they were against the state.[177] Union Berlin got a lot of sympathy as the weaker club.[177][1014] There was a simple rule in East German football, where the least privileged club got the most sympathy.[178] Supporters of Union Berlin cultivated the image of their club as the eternal underdog.[762][1015]\\n\\nClashes between the supporters of the two teams became increasingly common in the 1970s. Union Berlin had one of the most notorious followings in East Germany at this time.[32] The supporters of Union Berlin often went to away matches in large numbers.[32] Fights were initially won by the supporters of Union Berlin. They were in the clear majority and could chase the supporters of BFC Dynamo from the streets.[972] A punch in the face and a stolen scarf was an experience for many young supporters of BFC Dynamo at this time.[990] But BFC Dynamo gained more and more young supporters with its growing successes in the late 1970s.[174] Many came from working-class families in Prenzlauer Berg.[749] The supporters of BFC Dynamo would eventually begin to appear extremely well organized and by the early 1980s they began to fight back.[972][32] The tide now turned and the supporters of BFC Dynamo would win all fights between the supporters of the two teams from now on.[972][990] Derbies at the Stadion der Weltjugend usually ended with a couple of hundred supporters of BFC Dynamo chasing the supporters of Union Berlin along Chausseestraße down towards the Friedrichsstrasse S-Bahn station.[1016][32][1017] The fights often continued on the side streets of Friedrichstraße.[1017]\\n\\nUnion Berlin is sometimes portrayed as having been an opponent of the East German system and derbies between BFC Dynamo and Union Berlin during the East German era have been hyped as some kind of domestic political showdown.[1018] But Union Berlin was mostly just a club struggling against unfavorable conditions.[1018] The club had become disadvantaged by the state sports politics compared to local rival BFC Dynamo.[1018] Honorary President of Union Berlin Günter Mielis has said: \\\"Union was not a club of resistance fighters, but we had to fight against a lot of political and economic resistance over and over again. We got strength from our fans\\\".[1019] However, Union Berlin would eventually become known for a supporter scene that was anti-establishment, where dissidents could vent their disdain for the system in the anonymity of a crowd.[1010] Supporters of Union Berlin also saw themselves as stubborn and non-conformist, but this image should not be confused with actual resistance.[38] Provocation was part of football in East Germany and people shouted out anything, because it was possible to get away with it.[1020] A critical attitude to the system was something that football supporters across East Germany had in common in the 1970s and 1980s.[1021]\\n\\nSupporters of Union Berlin from the East German era concede that it is an exaggeration to call the club a \\\"resistance club\\\".[1022][970] A supporter of Union Berlin has said: \\\"With the best of intentions, Union fans did not contribute to the overthrow of the GDR. No way, we were interested in football. There is the cliché about the club for the enemies of the state, but that wasn\'t us\\\".[1023] There were no political groups among the supporters of Union Berlin.[1024] For some supporters of Union Berlin, the dissident reputation of Union Berlin is a legend that was created after Die Wende.[1022] A controversy erupted around Union Berlin in 2011 when it became publicly known that the then President of Union Berlin Dirk Zingler had been a member of the Stasi Guards Regiment \\\"Felix E. Dzerzhinsky\\\" for three years during his military service between 1983 and 1986.[1025][1026] Zingler explained that he had sought to spend his military service in Berlin and claimed that he did not know beforehand that the regiment belonged to the Stasi.[1027] However, the Stasi Guards Regiment \\\"Felix E. Dzerzhinsky\\\" was an elite formation; it was not possible to simply apply for the regiment. The Stasi selected who it thought were best fit to serve with the regiment, only accepting recruits that were \\\"loyal to the line\\\".[1027][1028] Zingler had also been a member of the Socialist Unity Party (SED) and leader in the Free German Youth (FDJ) at the time.[1029][1028] Union Berlin Press spokesman Christian Arbeit commented on the reports about Zingler in 2011 saying: \\\"We do have a very unique history, compared to other clubs. But it wasn\'t us that always claimed we were this big anti-Stasi club. These are stories that get simplified in the media.\\\"[1026]\\n\\nMost supporters of Union Berlin were just normal football supporters.[1020] Politics was not in the foreground.[970] Supporters of Union Berlin from the era have testified that their support for the club had nothing to do with politics.[1030] The club was the most important thing and the identification with Union Berlin had primarily to do with Köpenick.[1030][1031] The rivalry was fueled by local pride from the supporters of the two teams.[1032] However, the political dimension was there nonetheless.[1010] BFC Dynamo was supported by the Stasi, who was disliked by many.[1010] But above all, it was the political instrumentalization of football that irritated supporters of Union Berlin.[1033] The political favoritism of BFC Dynamo greatly contributed to the enthusiasm of the supporters of Union Berlin.[972] Supporters of Union Berlin embraced the image of the underdog fighting the odds.[1004] An expression of the supporters of Union Berlin was: \\\"Better to be a loser than a stupid Stasi pig\\\".[1011]\\n\\nThe derby between BFC Dynamo and Union Berlin was first and foremost a local football derby.[1010] Both clubs had supporters who were not loyal to the line.[1024][1034][751] Also supporters of BFC Dynamo were observed by the Stasi during the 1980s.[1035] East Berlin was divided into two: BFC Dynamo was more strongly represented in some parts, and Union Berlin was more strongly represented in other parts.[972] Which team you supported was very much a question of where you lived.[32] BFC Dynamo was the local team if you grew up in Prenzlauer Berg.[1036] And you lived in Mitte, you were also more likely to be a supporter BFC Dynamo, as the home stadium was only a stone\'s throw away along Schönhauser Allee.[32] But Mitte was also a contested area.[759] The border allegedly ran at Alexanderplatz, where many fights between the supporters of the two teams were fought.[972][760] The home districts of the two clubs, Hohenschönhausen and Köpenick respectively, were always dangerous territory for supporters of the other team.[972]\\n\\n\\nBFC Dynamo midfielder Bernd Schulz (right) celebrating together with team captain Frank Rohde (left) after scoring a goal against 1. FC Union Berlin at the Stadion der Weltjugend on 18 March 1989.\\nBFC Dynamo and Union Berlin met a total of 35 times in the DDR-Oberliga and the FDGB-Pokal. BFC Dynamo won 22 meetings and Union Berlin won 6 meetings. Matches against Union Berlin was often won with big numbers in the late 1970s and 1980s.[45][203] BFC Dynamo defeated Union Berlin with 1–8 and then 7–1 in the round of 16 of the 1978-79 FDGB-Pokal.[45] Hans-Jürgen Riediger scored a hat-trick in both legs.[1037][1038] BFC Dynamo also defeated Union Berlin 8–1 in the Oberliga on 13 September 1986. Thom, Frank Pastor and Christian Backs scored two goals each.[1039] The 1980s was a crushing win for BFC Dynamo. Former BFC Dynamo midfielder Falko Götz concluded that: \\\"Union was no opponent to us\\\".[1016] The two teams met 13 times in the Oberliga and FDGB-Pokal during the 1980s. BFC Dynamo won 11 matches and two matches ended in a draw. The matches between the two local rivals were hard-fought on the pitch.[294] Former BFC Dynamo midfielder Frank Terletzki has said that the victories against Union Berlin were always the best.[203] But despite the rivalry between the clubs, it happened that players hung out outside of football.[1040] Former BFC Dynamo defender Frank Rohde has said that players of BFC Dynamo and Union Berlin often gathered to have a beer together after matches.[294]\\n\\nThere were several transfers between the two clubs. BFC Dynamo recruited some of the best players of Union Berlin, such as Reinard Lauck in 1973, Detlef Helms in 1977 and Waldemar Ksienzyk in 1984.[45][970] But there were also transfers in the other direction. Union Berlin predecessor TSC Oberschöneweide recruited Ralf Quest from SC Dynamo Berlin in 1962. Quest scored the winning goal for Union Berlin in the final of the 1967-68 FDGB-Pokal, when the club won a sensational cup victory.[1041] Union Berlin would then recruit several players from BFC Dynamo over the years, such as Werner Heine in 1966, Werner Voigt, Bernd Kempke and Michael Jakob in 1973, Rainer Rohde in 1976, Rainer Wroblewski in 1977, Olaf Seier in 1983, Ralf Sträßer in 1984, Olaf Hirsch in 1986, Norbert Trieloff in 1987, Mario Maek in 1988, and Marco Kostmann and Thomas Grether in 1989, and Bernd Schulz in 1990.[95][970][294][1042] Union Berlin recruited a couple of players from BFC Dynamo in the 1980s who did some of their best seasons at the club.[1043][990] Olaf Seier became the team captain of Union Berlin and Ralf Sträßer became first and only player in Union Berlin to ever become league top goal scorer during the East German era.[65] Mario Maek saved Union Berlin from relegation with a late 3–2 goal against FC Karl-Marx-Stadt in the last match day of the 1987-88 DDR-Oberliga.[970][1044] As many as three former players of BFC Dynamo were involved in the winning goal for Union Berlin.[1044]\\n\\n\\nSupporters of FC Berlin during a match against 1. FC Union Berlin at the Stadion an der Alten Försterei on 23 September 1990.\\nUnion Berlin played in the DDR-Liga in the 1989–90 season. FC Berlin and Union Berlin met in the second round of the 1990-91 FDGB-Pokal at the Stadion an der Alten Försterei on 23 September 1990. It was the first match between the teams since the fall of the Berlin Wall. BFC Dynamo, now named FC Berlin, had now already lost many of its former top-performers to the West German Bundesliga.[1045][809] Union Berlin was now coached by the former BFC Dynamo player and youth coach Werner Voigt.[1046] Hooligans of FC Berlin stormed the home stands armed with clubs and flares and attacked supporters of Union Berlin at the beginning of the match.[263][809] Union Berlin won the match 2–1 on extra-time.[809] It was the first win for Union Berlin against FC Berlin since 1977.[263] Thomas Grether scored the first goal and Olaf Seier scored the winning goal for Union Berlin in the match. Both players had been brought up in the youth department of BFC Dynamo and had played matches for BFC Dynamo in the DDR-Oberliga.[809] Clashes between supporters of the two teams continued in the city after the match. Serious riots broke out in East Berlin, involving hundreds of supporters.[811]\\n\\nFC Berlin and Union Berlin then met in the promotion round to the 2. Bundesliga in the 1990–91 season. FC Berlin lost the first match 1–0 away in the second round at the Stadion an der Alten Försterei on 8 June 1991. Former BFC Dynamo player Bernd Schulz scored the winning goal for Union Berlin.[1047] FC Berlin then defeated Union Berlin 2–0 in the return match in fifth round in front of 9,475 spectators at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark on 18 June 1991. Heiko Bonan and Thorsten Boer scored one goal each in the match.[1048] FC Berlin was only one point behind leader BSG Stahl Brandenburg before the last round. The team managed to defeat Magdeburg 3–5 away on 23 June 1991. However, BSG Stahl Brandenburg defeated Union Berlin 2–0 away. FC Berlin thus finished in second place and missed promotion. Some supporters of BFC Dynamo are convinced that Union Berlin deliberately lost in order to prevent FC Berlin from advancing to the 2. Bundesliga.[257] FC Berlin and Union Berlin then also met in the promotion round for the 2. Bundesliga in 1991–92 season. FC Berlin won the first match 3–0 at home in the third round on 31 May 1992. The team then also won the return match 0–4 away in the fourth round on 7 June 1992.\\n\\nThe two teams met again in the new Regionalliga Nordost that was formed in 1994–95 season. Werner Voigt became the new coach of FC Berlin during the 1995–96 season. Voigt had a long history with BFC Dynamo but also had history with Union Berlin. Voigt had played for Union Berlin between 1973 and 1975 and had coached the team between 1990 and 1992.[1046] FC Berlin under coach Voigt lost 0–6 to 1. FC Union Berlin in the 1996–97 Regionalliga Nordost at the Stadion im Sportforum on 28 September 1996. It was the biggest defeat so far to Union Berlin.[294] Former FC Berlin player Thorsten Boer scored two goals for Union Berlin in the match.[1049] The two teams met 12 times in total in Regionalliga Nordost between 1994 and 2000. BFC Dynamo won one match and Union Berlin won eight matches. The two teams then met in the round of 16 of the 2000-01 Berlin Cup. The match was played in front of 4,427 spectators at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark on 24 March 2001.[351] Union Berlin won the match 0–3. Riots broke out among supporters of BFC Dynamo in Prenzlauer Berg after the match. The police had to deploy water cannons to control the situation.[855] The most recent meetings between BFC Dynamo and Union Berlin occurred in the 2005–06 NOFV-Oberliga Nord. The first match was played at the Stadion an der Alten Försterei on 21 August 2005. BFC Dynamo was missing striker Danny Kukulies and first-choice goalkeeper Nico Thomaschewski before the match. Kukulies was suspended and Thomaschewski injured.[1050][1051] German police and members of the SEK carried out a controversial raid against supporters of BFC Dynamo the night before the match.[440] Club management initially considered withdrawing from the match. The players voted on whether or not to play the match against Union Berlin.[865] More than 1,000 police officers were deployed to the match.[1016] BFC Dynamo eventually lost 8–0.[970] The return match was played at the Stadion im Sportforum on 13 May 2006. The score was 1–1 when around 200 supporters of BFC Dynamo stormed the pitch to attack supporters of Union Berlin.[456][871][873] Supporters of Union Berlin fled the guest block in panic.[872] The match was abandoned and Union Berlin was awarded a 2–0 victory.[871][873] The two teams has not met since then.\\n\\nBFC Dynamo met the reserve team of Union Berlin six times in the NOFV-Oberliga Nord and Regionalliga Nordost between 2010 and 2015. Union Berlin II won the first five matches. The last match was played in the 2014-15 Regionalliga Nordost on 15 March 2015. BFC Dynamo defeated Union Berlin II 1–0 in front of 8,169 spectators at Stadion an der Alten Försterei. The match was interrupted for 18 minutes when supporters of Union Berlin tried to attack the supporters of BFC Dynamo.[552][1052][45] 112 police officers were injured and 175 supporters were arrested during the match.[1053][45] Some media reported that 300 supporters of Union Berlin had participated in the attack on guest supporters. Journalist Frank Willmann attended the match and claims that the number was rather 30. He also said he did not see any injured police.[1052] There have been several cases of violence between the supporters of the two teams during the 2010s.[1054] Around a hundred hooligans from Union Berlin tried to attack a senior tournament organized by BFC Dynamo in the Dynamo-Sporthalle on 30 January 2010.[1055][1056][1057][875] Also women and children got in the way of the attack.[1057] Around 30 partially masked supporters from Union Berlin attacked players and a small group of supporters of BFC Dynamo in connection with a senior match between Union Berlin and BFC Dynamo at the Sportanlage Hämmerlingstraße in Köpenick on 27 March 2015.[1058][45][1054] One player of BFC Dynamo and two guest spectators were injured.[45] A number of supporters of BFC Dynamo joined Hertha BSC in the guest block of the Stadion an der Alten Försterei during the derby between Union Berlin and Hertha BSC on 2 November 2019.[899]\\n\\nOrganization\\nCurrent board and management\\nAs of 1 August 2023[1059][1060][1061][1062][1063]\\nBerliner Fussball Club Dynamo e.

The U17 team competes in the third tier B-Junior Verbandsliga Berlin and the U19 team competes in second tier A-Junior Regionalliga Nordost.[1094] The youth teams are based in the Sportforum Hohenschönhausen.[637]\\n\\nThere were more than 800 children and youth players in the club as of 2019.[1095] Many children in the club comes from immigrant backgrounds or socially disadvantaged families.[637][1096][626][753][608][634] BFC Dynamo helped football club FC Berlin 23 from neighbouring Storkower Straße in September 2021 and saved more than 40 to 50 children from the club, which was about to be dissolved.[608]\\n\\nThe club launched the so-called \\\"Kita-projekt\\\" in 2003.[637] The Kita-projekt is a day care project that gives boys and girls aged 3 to 6 the opportunity to participate in sports on a regular basis.[637][1097] The Kita-projekt involved approximately 200 children from 16 day care centers in Berlin as of 2020.[1096] The majority of the children come from the localities or former boroughs of Lichtenberg, Hohenschönhausen, Karlshorst, Mitte, Weißensee and Pankow.[1097] The Kita-projekt was the first of its kind in Germany and has received several awards for its work with children.[637][1098][1099] The former professional player of BFC Dynamo Jörn Lenz is the head of the Kita-projekt as of 2021.[1099]\\n\\nThe so-called \\\"Jugendförderverein\\\" was founded in 2004.[426] It is a registered voluntary association that aims to promote youth sports at BFC Dynamo. The Jugendförderverein has supported youth teams with equipment, covered costs for trips to tournaments and helped youth trainers to be able to obtain their trainer license. The Jugendförderverein relies on donations and voluntary work.[1100] Former Club President Mario Weinkauf was one of the seven founding members of the Jugenförderverein and briefly served as chairman of the association before he became club president. Weinkauf had also been a youth trainer in the club for some time.[426]\\n\\nYouth academy during East German era\\nBFC Dynamo had a very successful youth academy during the East German era.[1016][174][201] The youth department had full-time trainers available for all youth classes and access to the best material conditions in the Dynamo-Sportforum.[105][1101] There were no less than 40 full-time trainers in the club.[928] Youth coaches were highly qualified and training in the Children and Youth Sports School (KJS) was extensive.[1102][1103] The youth work at BFC Dynamo during the East German era was described as \\\"absolutely leading\\\" by former coach Jürgen Bogs, who had a background as coach of the junior team.[105][1101] It was also described as \\\"exquisite\\\" by former German sports journalist Horst Friedemann, who worked for Deutsches Sportecho and Kicker.[201]\\n\\nThe upper tier of elite clubs in East Germany had privileged access to talents within designated geographical and administrative areas.[4][1104] All designated football clubs were assigned one or two regional districts in East Germany as catchment areas at their founding in 1965–1966. BFC Dynamo was initially assigned Bezirk Cottbus and one third of the districts in East Berlin.[35][65] The club was later allowed to take over the training centers (German: Trainingszentrum) (TZ) in East Berlin that had previously belonged to the catchment area of FC Vorwärts Berlin, when FC Vorwärts Berlin was relocated to Frankfurt an der Oder before the 1971-72 season.[64][65]\\n\\nHowever, BFC Dynamo, as well as FC Vorwärts Berlin and SG Dynamo Dresden, also had another structural advantage when it came to recruiting talents.[1105] Most sports associations (German: Sportvereinigung) (SV) were dissolved at the founding of the DTSB in 1957.[1106] However, sports associations SV Dynamo and ASV Vorwärts were allowed to continue exist.[1107] A decision in the SED Politburo in 1962 then stipulated that the sports associations SV Dynamo and ASV Vorwärts were allowed to set up sports communities in each location where they operated offices. This meant that SV Dynamo and ASV Vorwärts would be able to run sports communities across the country.[1108] BFC Dynamo would eventually be able recruit talents from the youth departments of all sports communities (German: Sportgemeinschaft) (SG) of SV Dynamo in East Germany, except those in Bezirk Dresden and a number of other sports communities in the southern regional districts that belonged to the catchment area of SG Dynamo Dresden.[105][4][1109][nb 39]\\n\\nThe basis of the East German selection and screening system in competitive sports would eventually consist of special training centers (TZ).[1113][1114][nb 40] SV Dynamo would operate numerous training centers across the whole of East Germany. The training centers were either assigned to BFC Dynamo or SG Dynamo Dresden, depending on catchment area. Training in these training centers were better than elsewhere. The work in the training centers was supervised and directed by BFC Dynamo. The best talents from the individual training centers were then brought together and selected in a multi-day screening session.[69] BFC Dynamo would come to benefit from a nationwide scouting network, which included the partnership with Bezirk Cottbus and 33 training centers (TZ) of SV Dynamo.[1118][1119][68] In total, BFC Dynamo had access to 38 training centers (TZ) across East Germany for the recruitment of talents. As a comparison, Union Berlin had only access to six training centers (TZ), all of which were located in the Berlin area.[70]\\n\\nA number of football clubs became specially promoted focus clubs in the 1970 DFV Football Resolution.[60][999] The focus clubs would receive additional financial support from the DTSB and other advantages.[998][996] In the 1976 DFV Football Resolution, focus clubs were also allowed delegate youth players from other football clubs.[1001] BFC Dynamo became the focus club in East Berlin. As a focus club, BFC Dynamo had the right to delegate 12 students to its affiliated Children and Youth Sports Schools (KJS) every year.[1109][1002] Non-focus football clubs only had the right to delegate six students to their affiliated Children and Youth Sports School (KJS) every year.[1002] The elite Children and Youth Sports School (KJS) \\\"Werner Seelenbinder\\\" provided boarding and schooling for talented players in the Sportforum.[1120][1121][1107] The Children and Youth Sports School (KJS) \\\"Werner Seelenbinder\\\" was affiliated to sports club SC Dynamo Berlin.[1122]\\n\\nThe success of BFC Dynamo during the East German era was based on the club\'s extensive youth work.[1123][1124][105][201] In 1975, there were as many as five national team players in the East Germany junior national football team among the club\'s youth players from the class of 1957.[98]1 Only a fifth of the players who won the ten East German championships with BFC Dynamo were older than 18 years when they joined the club.[990] The youth academy produced stars such as Lutz Eigendorf, Falko Götz and Andreas Thom.[1120][1016][1102][752] Most of the top performers of BFC Dynamo in the 1980s came through the club\'s own youth teams, including Frank Terletzki, Hans-Jürgen Riediger, Norbert Trieloff, Bodo Rudwaleit, Ralf Sträßer, Artur Ullrich, Rainer Ernst, Bernd Schulz, Christian Backs, Frank Rohde, Falko Götz, Jan Voß, Andreas Thom, Jörg Fügner, Hendrik Herzog and Marco Köller.[1125][1126][1127] Several former players of SC Dynamo Berlin and BFC Dynamo became youth trainers in the club after ending their playing careers, such as Herbert Schoen, Hermann Bley, Günter Schröter, Martin Skaba, Peter Rohde, Werner Voigt, Hartmut Pelka and Hans-Jürgen Riediger.[1128][1129][1125][1130][1131]\\n\\nNumerous players from East Germany joined West German clubs at the end of East Germany. Many came from BFC Dynamo. More than 110 players who had been trained in East Germany, primarily in a Children and Youth Sports School (KJS), would go on to play for West German or West Berlin clubs in the Bundesliga after the end of East Germany. German author Michael Peter has created a database for all players who had been trained in East Germany and who played for West German or West Berlin football clubs after 1990. For players born before 1976, BFC Dynamo was the biggest contributor. 98 players, born before 1976, came from the ten designated football clubs and SG Dynamo Dresden. 18 of these, came from BFC Dynamo.[1108]\\n\\nHonours\\nNext Generation Oberliga (German: Nachwuchsoberliga) (de)[a]\\nWinners: 1981, 1991[b]\\nRunners-up (6): 1979, 1983\\nEast German Junior Championship (de)[c]\\nWinners: (5) 1960,[d] 1978, 1979, 1987, 1991\\nRunners-up (6): 1967, 1974, 1976, 1977, 1988, 1989\\nEast German Youth Championship (Youth FDJ-Pokal) (de)[e]\\nWinners: (4) 1967, 1972, 1975, 1987\\nRunners-up: 1983, 1989\\nEast German Junior Cup (Junge Welt-Pokal) (de)[c]\\nWinners: (5) 1966, 1967, 1987, 1989, 1990[b] (record)\\nEast German Youth Cup (Youth FDGB-Pokal)[e]\\nWinners: (5) 1965,[d] 1968, 1971, 1972, 1976 (record)\\n Corresponds to U21 level. The league existed from 1976 to 1983 and 1989 to 1991. The reserve teams of the 14 DDR-Oberliga clubs were no longer allowed to participate in the DDR-Liga after the 1975-76 season. The Junior Oberliga (de) was also disbanded after the season. The Next Generation Oberliga was introduced instead. Youth teams of the 14 DDR-Oberliga clubs were all were eligible to start in the 1976-77 Next Generation Oberliga. Next Generation Oberliga was disbanded after the 1982-83 season. All teams were instead assigned to the third tier Bezirksliga. BFC Dynamo participted in the 1983-84 Bezirksliga Berlin with reseve team BFC Dynamo II. BFC Dynamo II won the 1983-84 Bezirksliga Berlin and qualified for the 1984-85 DDR-Liga A.\\n Won as FC Berlin.\\n Corresponds to U19 level.\\n Won by SC Dynamo Berlin.\\n Corresponds to U17 level.\\nExplanatory notes\\n This was not the first or last relocation or transfer of entire football teams in East Germany at the time. Sports association SV Deutsche Volkpolizei relocated its three second-tier teams SV Deutsche Volkspolizei Potsdam, SV Deutsche Volkspolizei Weimar and SV Deutsche Volkspolizei Schwerin to sports communities in larger cities during the summer of 1952. SV Deutsche Volkspolizei Potsdam was relocated to Berlin, SV Deutsche Volkspolizei Weimar to Erfurt and SV Deutsche Volkspolizei Schwerin to Rostock.[6]The team of SV Vorwärts der KVP Leipzig was relocated to East Berlin in 1953. The team continued the 1953-54 DDR-Oberliga as SV Vorwärts der KVP Berlin. SV Vorwärts der KVP Berlin then became ASK Vorwärts Berlin, which later became FC Vorwärts Berlin.[7][4] The relatively successful team of BSG Empor Lauter and its place in the DDR-Oberliga was transferred to sports club SC Empor Rostock in 1954. The football department of SC Empor Rostock later became F.C. Hansa Rostock.[8] The team of BSG Turbine Halle and its place in the DDR-Oberliga was transferred to sports club SC Chemie Halle-Leuna in 1954.[9] The football department of SC Chemie Halle-Leuna later became Hallescher FC Chemie.\\n SG Dynamo Dresden itself had a background that involved political interference and player delegations. SG Dynamo Dresden was previously known as SV Deutsche Volkspolizei Dresden. When SG Friedrichstadt was dissolved by East German sports authorities after the 1949–50 DDR-Oberliga, the playing right in the DDR-Oberliga was transferred to SV Deutsche Volkspolizei Dresden.[10][8][11] SV Deutsche Volkspolizei Dresden had previously played in the lower-tier Stadtliga Dresden and was thus able to enter the DDR-Oberliga without having to progress through divisions.[12][13] In order to keep the place in the DDR-Oberliga, the team of SV Deutsche Volkspolizei Dresden would be reinforced with players from Volkspolizei teams all over the country.[14] The head of the Volkspolizei Kurt Fischer ordered that best football players in the sports communities of the Volkspolizei around East Germany should be concentrated in the now first-tier SV Deutsche Volkspolizei Dresden.[15] The 40 best players of the various Volkspolizei teams in East Germany were then brought together for a training session in Forst in July 1950. Coaches Fritz Sack and Paul Döring then picked out 17 players from 11 different cities who were delegated to Dresden to form the team.[16][11] SV Deutsche Volkspolizei Potsdam lost its five best players and was severaly weakened.[13][17]\\n However, newspaper Neues Deutschland reported an attendance number of 60,000 spectators.[20]\\n BFC Dynamo played friendly matches against Pogoń Szczecin in 1966, 1969, 1973, two times in 1975, 1977, two times in 1978, 1980, 1984, 1985, 1986 and 1987.[43]\\n SV Dynamo would eventually operate numerous training centers (TZ) across East Germany. The training centers were divided between BFC Dynamo and SG Dynamo Dresden depending on catchment area.[69]\\n German author Steffen Karas also claims in his book \\\"66 Jahre BFC Dynamo - Auswärts mit \'nem Bus\\\" that BFC Dynamo actually only scored nine match-deciding goals in the 86th minute or later, in the 218 matches it won or drew during its ten championship years. Only one of those goals came from a penalty. That penalty was the controversial penalty against 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig in the 1985-86 DDR-Oberliga on 22 March 1986, which was later proven to be correct.[205]\\n Karin Halsch was known as Karin Seidel-Kalmutzki at the time.[339]\\n Sources vary on the history of the stadium. A few sources state that the stadium was constructed in 1954 and then refurbished in 1973.[685][693] A centrally located football stadium is depicted in the early plans for the Dynamo-Sportforum by architects Walter Schmidt and Heinz Scharlipp.[694] Other sources suggest that the stadium was completed in its current form in 1970.[695][688][696]\\n The capacity was 12,000 at the beginning of the 1966–67 season and 14,000 at the beginning of the 1968–69 season.[706][707]\\n The skinhead movement in East Germany grew out of the punk subculture, and was characterized as an aggressive form of protest.[777][778] It was radicalized in the middle of the 1980s, by a hybrid of ultranationalism, xenophobia and anti-communism.[778] East Berlin was the epicenter of the East German skinhead movement, with BFC Dynamo and 1. FC Union Berlin as its two football magnets.[778][779] The Stasi concluded that about 30-40 skinheads were associated to the two clubs in December 1985. Many were attached to fan cub Anale Berlin at BFC Dynamo.[778] Anale Berlin became infamous for its violence capital and glorification of fascism.[778][779] There were around 300–400 skinheads in East Berlin in December 1987.[780][717] Many were fans of BFC Dynamo.[717] Reports noted a group of roughly 100 skinheads that regularly attended the away matches of BFC Dynamo in 1988.[781] And the Stasi estimated that there were about 30 skinheads among the followers of 1. FC Union Berlin in July 1988.[4][781] Despite the fierce rivalry between BFC Dynamo and 1. FC Union Berlin, there were contacts between skinheads of the two clubs.[32] Far-right skinheads were attached to fan clubs Borussen and Die Löwen at 1. FC Union Berlin.[772][782]\\n However, hooligans of BFC Dynamo and skinheads allegedly attached to the hooligan scene of BFC Dynamo were also involved in serious incidents associated with racism and right wing-extremism in the 1980s. Hooligans of BFC Dynamo attacked 26 Cuban guest workers on train D 1056 towards Berlin-Lichtenberg, while returning from a match in Halle on 12 May 1984.[788][789] The hooligans had allegedly shouted racist slogans and sung the Deutschlandlied. At least nine Cubans were injured.[790] A number of skinheads allegedly attached to the hooligan scene of BFC Dynamo were also among those convicted for the much-publicized attack on a punk concert in the Zionskirche church in East Berlin on 17 October 1987.[178][137] However, incidents associated to racism and right-wing extremism in East German football were not isolated to BFC Dynamo and authorities also recorded the use of racists slogans, such as \\\"Jewish pigs!\\\", by supporters of several other teams at the time, including SG Dynamo Dresden and 1. FC Union Berlin.[791][792][793]\\n Several sources claim that a group of 500 hooligans of BFC Dynamo attacked a gas station, looted shops and attacked the Volkspolizei in Jena in November 1989.[32][799][459][788][798] One source specifically claims that the incidents occurred in connection to an away match in the DDR-Oberliga.[799] However, the sources do not specify any exact date or any details regarding which match the incidents occur in connection with. FC Berlin played away against FC Carl Zeiss Jena in the 18th matchday of the 1989-90 DDR-Oberliga on 8 April 1990.\\n Hooligans in Magdeburg attacked Soviet soldiers on 29 August 1990. One officer fired a warning shot.[803] The police fired warning shots during violent riots after the friendly match between 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig and FC Bayern Munich on 6 September 1990.[803][813][815] The match between FC Sachsen Leipzig and FC Carl Zeiss Jena in the 1990-91 NOFV-Oberliga on 29 September 1990 was abandoned shortly before the end due to violent riots in the stadium.[813][814]\\n However, the high number of supporters of FC Berlin at the scene claimed by the police has been disputed.[820] The number of supporters of FC Berlin on the scene varies between different sources. The police initially stated that they had faced up to 500 hooligans.[817][824] However, an eyewitness stated that the group that arrived at the S-Bahn station and marched towards the stadium rather consisted of only 150 supporters. This group was supposedly met by around 50 police officers outside the stadium.[820] Neues Deutschland reported that the number of rioters outside the stadium \\\"grew to around 400 to 500 hooligans\\\".[819] A common figure is that 400 supporters of FC Berlin arrived at the S-Bahn station after kick-off.[823][802][825][264] A supporter of FC Berlin has said in Zeit that there were almost 500 supporters of FC Berlin outside the stadium.[265]\\n Another legend tells that Erich Mielke made a remark about bringing the title to Berlin after the fractious encounter between Dynamo Dresden and BFC Dynamo on 2 December 1978, when he allegedly walked into the locker room of Dynamo Dresden and told the players that \\\"You must understand, the capital city needs a champion!\\\".[923] However, according to another version, he instead made this remark when the players of Dynamo Dresden celebrated their title in 1978 and he allegedly ghosted into their locker room to inform them that BFC Dynamo will be champions next year.[924] And according to yet another version, this happened instead after BFC Dynamo had won its second title in 1980, when Erich Mielke allegedly told the players of Dynamo Dresden that \\\"One must understand, the capital city needs a champion.\\\"[178] Dynamo Dresden was one point ahead of BFC Dynamo before the last match day of the 1979-80 DDR-Oberliga. BFC Dynamo met Dynamo Dresden home in the last matchday on 10 May 1980. BFC Dynamo won the match 1-0 and captured the league title. Dynamo Dresden player Udo Schmuck remembers how Mielke came into the locker room of Dynamo Dresden after the match with a gold medal around his neck. He allegedly said: \\\"It doesn\'t matter. The main thing is that Dynamo is champion!\\\".[925] Mielke is also said to have told Dynamo Dresden player Hans-Jürgen Dörner at the same occasion; \\\"Comrade Dörner, it is clear to all of you that the title belongs in the capital, now it\'s the turn of the BFC.\\\"[926]\\n Former SG Dynamo Dresden coach Klaus Sammer claimed in an interview with Berliner Zeitung in 2003 that with \\\"a few exceptions\\\", SG Dynamo Dresden was only able to fall back on the Bezirk Dresden as catchment area.[929] However, Bezirk Dresden was one of the most populous regional districts in East Germany. East German sports journalist Horst Friedemann claims that the SV Dynamo sports communities (SG) of Eisleben and Halle/Neustadt also belonged to the catchment area of SG Dynamo Dresden. They were located under the \\\"southern line\\\", where Dresden had access.[930] SG Dynamo Dresden also had access to training centers (TZ) of SV Dynamo. SV Dynamo operated numerous training centers across East Germany. The training centers were either assigned to BFC Dynamo or SG Dynamo Dresden, depending on catchment area.[931] In total, SG Dynamo Dresden had 35 partner associations (German: Partnervereine), including training centers (TZ). Their task was mainly to scout the best players and then send them to Dresden.[932] German sports historian Hanns Leske has categorized SG Dynamo Dresden as the third most privileged football club or sports community in East German football, behind FC Vorwärts Berlin and BFC Dynamo.[933]\\n Supporters of 1. FC Union Berlin used the same provocation at away matches in Saxony, despite their cultivation of their club\'s underdog image. A supporter of 1. FC Union Berlin has testified that they brought Cuban organges and rotten bananas to an away match against FC Karl-Marx-Stadt, fully aware that these fruits were symbols of their privileges as East Berliners.[962]\\n BFC Dynamo was officially a club of the Ministry of the Interior.[973] The official sponsor (German: Träger) of the club was the Volkspolizei.[36] The official sponsor of Union Berlin was the state-owned combine VVB Hochspannungsgeräte und Kabel.[974]\\n The football clubs had been assigned one or two districts in East Germany as catchment areas at their founding. 1. FC Union Berlin had been assigned Bezirk Potsdam and one third of all training centers (TZ) in East Berlin. BFC Dynamo had been assigned Bezirk Cottbus and one third of training centers (TZ) in East Berlin. BFC Dynamo now had access to Bezirk Cottbus and two thirds of all training centers (TZ) in East Berlin. 1. FC Union Berlin on the other hand had to make do with its training centers (TZ) in East Berlin.[35][970]\\n FC Vorwärts Berlin was initially a focus club in East Berlin.[1000] The only major club in East Berlin that was never appointed as focus club was 1. FC Union Berlin.[60] FC Vorwärts Berlin continued to be part of the group of focus clubs after its relocation to Frankfurt an der Oder.[1000]\\n Football clubs were given performance assignments from the DTSB that had to be fulfilled. The clubs then had to report on the fulfillment in two-year analyzes. Union Berlin had the objective in 1977-78 of producing four players who could be delegated to the focus club BFC Dynamo. Union Berlin explained that its downward trend in the youth area was due to the fact that the club had to delegate its two best players to the focus club every year and that the club could only rely on four districts in East Berlin for further selection.[978]\\n The club management of 1. FC Union Berlin seriously considered moving all matches to Stadion der Weltjugend after a stormy encounter with BSG Wismut Aue in 1976.[1007]\\n Manfred Kirste was the first president and is the longest serving president. He served as president from 15 January 1966 to 30 August 1988.\\n Served as president until 19 Februari 1990.[1064]\\n Became acting president after the dismissal of Herbert Krafft on 19 February 1990. Bogs served as acting president until 27 May 1990.[1064]\\n Dr. Klaus Janz served as president until 15 October 1990.[1065] He asked to be relieved from the office due to professional stress as a lawyer. He continued as vice president.[1066]\\n Dr. Wolfgang Hösrich became president on 15 October 1990. He had a background as a club doctor for SC Dynamo Berlin and BFC Dynamo. Hösrich had previously served as vice president.[1067][1066] The presidium under Dr. Wolfgang Hösrich was replaced by a new presidium under Eberhard Landmann on 20 May 1994.[1068][1069][1070]\\n Eberhard Landmann became president on 20 May 1994.[1071] Landmann was a former insurance salesman. He only served as president for nine months.[1068][1069][1072]\\n Klaus Bittroff was elected as the new president on 10 February 1995 with the votes 73-11. Volkmar Wanski was elected as one of two vice presidents alongside re-elected Lutz Hoff.[1073][1072][1071] Bittroff had previously served as president of Wacker 04 Berlin from 1984 to 1991.[1071]\\n Became new president after the resignation of Klaus Bittroff on 14 September 1995.[287] Wanski resigned on 29 June 2000.[335][1072][1074]\\n Sports director Hans Reker was appointed acting president by the Economic council following the resignation of Volkmar Wanski on 29 June 2000.[335][1074] Karin Halsch took office as new president on 27 September 2000.[339]\\n Karin Halsch was known as Karin Seidel-Kalmutzki during the era. Served from 27 September 2000 to 25 June 2001.[339][1075]\\n Sports director Hans Reker served as acting president following the resignation of Karin Halsch on 25 June 2001.[1075][356] Hans Reker held the position of vice president in the presidium of Karin Halsch.[1076][346] He resigned together with the entire presidium on 30 October 2001.[376] An emergency board formed by André Sommer, Rayk Bernt and press spokesman Holger Zimmermann took office. The emergency board was meant to serve until the extraordinary general meeting on 26 November 2001.[376][387]\\n An emergency board formed by André Sommer, Rayk Bernt and press spokesman Holger Zimmermann took office on 1 November 2001. No new president was appointed for the transitional board.[376][387] Zimmerman soon resigned on 23 November 2001.[653] A new presidium was due to be elected on the extraordinary general meeting on 26 November 2001. However, the meeting agenda was changed with the votes 87 to 59 at the insistence of the emergency board. The meeting was converted into an information event and new elections were postponed.[653][1077] Club members collected signatures for the election of a new presidium. But the signatures would be ignored by Sommer and Bernt.[388] The Sommer and Bernt presidium was finally overthrown by supporters and the former coach of the women\'s team Volkmar Lucius after an application to the Charlottenburg district court.[388][401] The Charlottenburg district court appointed Lucius as emergency board member.[388] A new presidium was elected on the extraordinary general meeting on 31 May 2002.[1078]\\n Elected on an extraordinary general meeting on 31 May 2002.[1078]\\n Mario Weinkauf was elected president on 18 June 2004.[426] He resigned on a meeting with the presidium on 22 June 2007. He was then dismissed in a vote of no-confidence on an extra-ordinary general meeting on 23 June 2007. Mario Weinkauf was succeeded by Volkmar Wanski as interim president. Volkmar Wanski had been co-opted into the presidium and elected as the provisional successor to Mario Weinkauf on the meeting with the presidium on 22 June 2007. However the interim presidency of Volkmar Wanski was controversial. It was put into question whether his election was compliant with club statutes. Volkmar Wanski resigned after only six days.[1079][1080][1081]\\n Frank Bertron was launched as interim president by the Economic Council under Peter Meyer.[487][1081] He was presented as new president on 28 June 2007.[1081]\\n Norbert Uhlig is the second longest serving president after Manfred Kirste. Norbert Uhlig has been president since 11 October 2008.[1082]\\n German sports historian Hanns Leske writes that BFC Dynamo was able to recruit young players from the youth departments of all sports communities (SG) of SV Dynamo in East Germany, except those in Bezirk Dresden.[1110] German author Anne Hahn writes that the training centers (TZ) of SV Dynamo across East Germany were divided between BFC Dynamo and SG Dynamo Dresden. She writes that the catchment area of BFC Dynamo included the SV Dynamo sports communities (SG) of Rostock-Mitte, Neustrelitz, Fürstenwalde, Schwerin and Berlin. The best talents were brought together in these training centers and then selected in a central, multi-day screening courses.[931] Also Horst Friedemann claims that the catchment area of BFC Dynamo included the SV Dynamo sports communities (SG) of Rostock-Mitte, Neustrelitz, Fürstenwalde and Schwerin. According to Friedemann, the SV Dynamo sports communities (SG) of Eisleben and Halle/Neustadt instead belonged to the catchment area of SG Dynamo Dresden. That was the \\\"southern line\\\", where Dresden had access.[1111][1112]\\n The training centers (TZ) were the first preparatory stage for the support of children found suitable for sports. Training in training centers usually started at the age of 10.[1115] The training course usually lasted for three to four years.[1115] From the training centers, the best young talents could then be delegated to a Children and Youth Sports School (KJS) and a Sports club (SC) or a Football club (FC).[1116][1113][1117]\\nReferences\\nTemplate:Reflist\\n\\nFurther reading\\nTemplate:Cite news\\nBertram, Marco (2015).
